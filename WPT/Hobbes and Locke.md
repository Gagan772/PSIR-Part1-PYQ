## <a id="q3"></a>Q3: Hobbesian notion of Political Obligation (2017, 10M)

### 🎯 Core Theme

## <a id="q8"></a>Q8: Individualism inherent in Hobbes's absolutist ideology (2022, 15M)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Despite advocating absolute sovereignty, Hobbes's philosophy contains inherent individualism: state of nature depicts individuals with natural rights and rational self-interest; social contract emerges from individual rational choice for self-preservation; however, individualism subordinated to absolutism once sovereign established, creating tension between individual motivations and total surrender of rights.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms

- Exchange for protection of lives and property
- Fundamentally individualistic act
- Grounded in recognition of cooperation benefits

**IV. Tension: Individualism vs. Absolutism**
- However, individualism doesn't imply liberal freedoms
- Doesn't endorse democracy
- Serves as foundation for absolutism argument
- Once social contract established
- Sovereign authority holds absolute power
- Ensure peace and security
- For Hobbes: relinquishing rights is total
- Except right to self-preservation

**V. Total Surrender to Sovereign**
- Sovereign's decisions uncontestable
- Subjects' obligation to obey unconditional
- Highlights tension between:
  - Recognition of individual motivations
  - Prescription for absolute government
- Individual agency only in forming contract
- Thereafter, complete submission
- No ongoing consent or participation

**VI. Scholarly Debates on Hobbes's Individualism**
- Critics and scholars debated views
- Some argue: absolutist state negates individualism
- Subsumes all rights under sovereign's will
- Others see: acknowledgment of individual rationality
- Recognition of rights in state of nature
- Important contribution to political individualism
- Even if ultimate solution diverges from liberal theories
- Initial premises individualistic

**VII. Contribution to Development of Individualism**

- Capable of making choices for self-preservation
- Foundation for later liberal theory
- Though Hobbes takes different path

## <a id="q10"></a>Q10: State of Nature as State of War - Hobbes (2023, 10M)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Hobbes's "Leviathan" depicts state of nature not merely as absence of government but as psychological and physical condition of perpetual war driven by self-interest, mistrust, and competition; life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" necessitates social contract establishing absolute Leviathan sovereign to enforce order and prevent return to natural chaos.

- Competition inherent in human nature

**II. Comprehensive Description of State of Nature**
- Famous extended quote:
  - "No place for industry, fruit uncertain"
  - "No culture of the earth"
  - "No navigation, nor use of commodities by sea"
  - "No commodious building"
  - "No instruments of moving/removing things"
  - "No knowledge of face of earth"
  - "No account of time"
  - "No arts; no letters; no society"
  - "Worst of all: continual fear and danger of violent death"

**III. Physical and Psychological War**
- Not just physical war
- Psychological condition of constant fear
- Readiness for conflict perpetual
- Arises not only from actual conflicts
- Also from general mistrust among individuals
- Everyone must be prepared to defend
- Against potential threats constantly
- State of alertness and anxiety

**IV. Causes of Perpetual War**
- Three principal causes:

- Individuals collectively agree
- Surrender natural freedoms
- To sovereign authority (Leviathan)
- In exchange for security and order
- Sovereign endowed with absolute power
- Ensures peace through law enforcement
- Overcomes anarchic tendencies

**VI. Justification of Absolute Power**
- Absolute power of Leviathan justified
- Only viable means to prevent return
- To state of nature's intolerable conditions
- Alternative is perpetual war
- Any limitation on sovereign risks collapse
- Back to natural chaos
- Complete authority necessary
- For complete security

**VII. Influential and Contentious Conception**

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Hobbes's equation of nature with war strips away civilization's veneer to reveal humanity's darkest truth: that without the iron hand of authority, our vaunted freedom degenerates into mutual terror—a haunting reminder that order, however oppressive, may be the price we pay for survival itself."*
