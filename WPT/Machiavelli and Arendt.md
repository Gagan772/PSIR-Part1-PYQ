## HANNAH ARENDT

## <a id="q10"></a>Q10: Conceptual triad - labour, work, action (Arendt) (2019, 15M)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Arendt's "The Human Condition" (1958) distinguishes labor (biological necessity, cyclical, non-lasting), work (fabrication of durable human-made world), and action (political engagement revealing individuality through speech and deeds in public sphere); triad illuminates vita activa, though debated for overlaps, gender implications, and potential undervaluation of labor and work.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Vita Activa | Labour-Work-Action | The Human Condition | Biological Cycle | Worldliness | Plurality | Public Sphere | Freedom & Politics | Durability | Human Activities Hierarchy`

---

### 📝 Answer Structure

#### **Introduction**

- Highest form of human activity

**IV. Critical Analysis and Debates**

- Compared to "male" sphere
- Of public action and politics
- Gendered division problematic

**D. Potential Overlaps in Modern Context**

#### **Conclusion**

POWER ≠ VIOLENCE
Power = Persuasion, Dialogue, Consensus

```

---

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Arendt's radical insight—that power belongs not to rulers but to the ruled acting together—inverts political philosophy's foundation: true authority flows from collective consent continuously renewed, making power simultaneously more fragile (dissolves when unity breaks) and more potent (unstoppable when people stand united) than any individual's command."*
