10 Western Political Thoughts 
 
Plato 
 

Q.1) “Plato was an enemy of open society.” (Popper) Comment. (2015) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Begin by stating Karl Popper's critical view of Plato as presented in "The Open Society and Its Enemies," 

where he labels Plato as an antagonist to the concept of an open society. 
Body:  
• Detail Popper's arguments against Plato's theory of Forms and the concept of philosopher-kings, 

emphasizing how these ideas conflict with the principles of democratic governance and individual 
freedom that characterize an open society. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance of Popper's critique and the ensuing debates, highlighting the relevance of 

this discussion to understanding the intersection of philosophical ideals and political systems. 
 
Karl Popper's characterization of Plato as an "enemy of open society" is a central theme in his influential work, 
"The Open Society and Its Enemies," first published in 1945. In this seminal text, Popper critiques the 
philosophical foundations of totalitarianism, tracing its intellectual roots back to Plato's political philosophy as 
presented in works such as "The Republic." Popper argues that Plato's ideal state, governed by philosopher-
kings and structured according to a rigid class system, fundamentally opposes the principles of an open society, 
characterized by democratic governance, individual freedom, and the open exchange of ideas. 
 
Popper's critique focuses on several aspects of Plato's philosophy. Firstly, he takes issue with Plato's theory of 
Forms or Ideas, which posits the existence of immutable, eternal truths. Popper sees this as antithetical to the 
critical and questioning spirit of an open society, where knowledge progresses through conjecture and 
refutation, rather than adherence to dogmatic principles. According to Popper, "Plato's theory of Forms or 
Ideas...and his invention of the myth of a golden age in the distant past, are all elements in his conservative 
philosophy of 'arrested change'." 
 
Secondly, Popper criticizes Plato's ideal of the philosopher-king, arguing that it embodies a form of elitism and 
authoritarianism. In Plato's vision, the philosopher-kings, as the only ones capable of grasping the true Forms, 
are deemed uniquely qualified to rule. Popper contends that this idea undermines the democratic principle 
that governance should be based on the consent of the governed and that power should be subject to checks 
and balances. He argues that Plato's state is fundamentally a totalitarian one, where the ruling class is justified 
in manipulating and deceiving the masses for the sake of social order. 
 
Furthermore, Popper takes issue with Plato's concept of justice, as outlined in "The Republic," where 
individuals are expected to perform the social roles into which they are born, based on their natural aptitudes. 
Popper argues that this notion of justice as social harmony through hierarchical order stifles individual 
freedom and the opportunity for social mobility, both of which are crucial for the vitality of an open society.

It's important to note, however, that Popper's interpretation of Plato has been subject to criticism and debate. 
Some scholars argue that Popper's reading is overly simplistic and fails to account for the nuanced and 
allegorical nature of Plato's writings. They suggest that Plato's work can also be seen as a critique of the very 
totalitarian tendencies that Popper attributes to him, especially considering the historical context of Athens' 
decline and the corruption of its democratic processes. 
 
In conclusion, Karl Popper's characterization of Plato as an "enemy of open society" is a provocative critique 
that raises important questions about the relationship between philosophical ideals and political systems. 
While Popper's analysis offers a compelling warning against the dangers of authoritarianism and dogmatism, 
it also invites a deeper exploration of Plato's complex and multifaceted contributions to political philosophy. 
The debate over Plato's legacy highlights the ongoing tension between the values of open societies and the 
search for order and stability in political life. 
 

Q.2) Explain Aristotle's critique of Plato's Idealism. (20) (2019) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Aristotle as a critical follower of Plato, highlighting his divergence from Plato's Idealism 

toward a more empirical and materialistic philosophical stance. 
Body:  
• Explain Aristotle's rejection of the Theory of Forms and independent realms, his concept of 

hylomorphism, and his practical critique of Plato’s political theories, illustrating Aristotle’s approach to 
forms, matter, and societal organization. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how Aristotle's critiques represent a significant philosophical shift towards empiricism and 

practicality in understanding reality and governing societies. 
 
Aristotle, one of the most influential philosophers in history, was both a student and a critic of Plato. While 
deeply respectful of his mentor, Aristotle diverged significantly from Plato's philosophical frameworks, 
particularly regarding Idealism. Plato's Idealism posits that the material world is a shadowy representation of 
a higher, truer reality composed of unchanging, perfect forms or ideas. This realm of forms, according to Plato, 
is the only object of true knowledge, as it is eternal and immutable, unlike the fleeting and imperfect material 
world. 
 
Aristotle's critique of Plato's Idealism is rooted in his more empirical and materialistic approach to philosophy. 
Aristotle argued that forms or ideas cannot exist independently of physical objects, a concept central to his 
metaphysics. For Aristotle, the essence of things (what he referred to as 'form') is not separated from the 
things themselves but is embodied in the objects we perceive in the material world. This view is encapsulated 
in his famous critique in the "Metaphysics" where he argues against the Theory of Forms by questioning how 
these ideal forms contribute to the explanation of the concrete reality we experience. Aristotle suggests that 
knowing the form of an object does not necessitate the existence of a separate, higher realm of reality; rather, 
forms and matter are intertwined.

Aristotle also introduced the concept of hylomorphism, which posits that everything in the natural world is 
composed of both matter (hyle) and form (morphe), with form giving shape and purpose to matter. This stands 
in contrast to Plato's dualism of the world of forms and the material world, proposing instead a more unified 
vision of reality where forms exist within things rather than in a transcendental realm. 
 
Furthermore, Aristotle criticized Plato's ideal state (as outlined in "The Republic"), arguing that Plato's vision 
of philosopher-kings and a rigid class structure was impractical and ignored the complex nature of human 
societies and the potential for change within them. Aristotle's own political philosophy, detailed in "Politics," 
advocates for a mixed government model that acknowledges the value of the middle class and emphasizes 
the importance of education and moral virtue for all citizens, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of 
political organization. 
 
In terms of epistemology, Aristotle's critique extends to Plato's disparagement of the sensory world. Where 
Plato doubted the reliability of sensory perception for achieving true knowledge, Aristotle saw observation 
and experience as foundational to understanding the world. This empiricist stance informed his scientific 
investigations and led to significant contributions to various fields, including biology, physics, and ethics. 
 
In summary, Aristotle's critique of Plato's Idealism is multifaceted, challenging the separation of forms and 
matter, the disregard for the sensory world, and the feasibility of Plato's political ideals. Aristotle's philosophy 
represents a shift towards a more empirical and immanent approach to understanding reality, emphasizing 
the importance of form and matter's unity, the role of observation and experience in knowledge, and the 
practical considerations of political life. 
 

Q.3) "Examine Plato's perspective on gender equality in education and governance in 'The Republic.' To what 
extent were his ideas progressive for his time, and what contemporary lessons can be drawn?" (20 
Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Start by highlighting Plato's progressive views on gender equality as presented in "The Republic," 

especially regarding education and governance. 
Body:  
• Discuss Plato’s arguments from Book V of "The Republic," emphasizing his belief that women and men 

are equal in capacities relevant to leadership and should receive the same educational opportunities. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the relevance and limitations of Plato’s ideas on gender equality, noting their impact on 

contemporary discussions about gender roles and leadership. 
 
Plato's perspective on gender equality, particularly in the realms of education and governance, as presented 
in "The Republic," is one of the most forward-thinking aspects of his philosophical legacy. In "The Republic," 
Plato articulates a vision of an ideal society where the roles of individuals are determined by their abilities and 
virtues rather than by their birth or gender. This idea, radical for its time, posits that women, like men, possess 
the potential to attain the highest levels of knowledge and virtue, and therefore should be afforded the same 
opportunities in education and governance.

Plato's argument for gender equality is primarily located in Book V of "The Republic," where he engages in a 
dialogue with Glaucon and others to explore the nature of justice and the ideal state. Here, Plato suggests that 
the only relevant differences among individuals are those related to their roles in society — differences of skill, 
aptitude, and natural ability. Gender, in Plato's view, does not inherently limit an individual's capacity for 
wisdom, courage, or any other virtue necessary for leadership. He states, "If it is evident that both male and 
female watchdogs perform the same functions, so too for human beings: men and women have the same 
nature in respect to the guardianship of the city, except insofar as the one is weaker and the other stronger." 
 
Plato's proposal that women should be educated and trained alongside men in the guardian class was 
profoundly progressive, challenging the prevailing notions of gender roles in ancient Greek society. He 
envisioned a communal system of living for guardians where traditional family structures were dissolved to 
prevent personal loyalties from interfering with the common good, further emphasizing the equality of men 
and women in contributing to the welfare of the state. 
 
Despite the progressive nature of these ideas, it is important to note that Plato's advocacy for gender equality 
was not without its limitations. His proposals applied primarily to the guardian class, and his vision of gender 
roles still reflected some of the biases of his time. Moreover, the radical communalism he proposed, including 
shared property and children, aimed more at eliminating personal biases and conflicts within the ruling class 
than at promoting individual liberty or gender equality per se. 
 
In the contemporary context, Plato's ideas on gender equality in education and governance offer valuable 
lessons on the importance of recognizing and nurturing potential based on merit rather than gender. They 
remind us of the need to create educational and professional environments that enable all individuals to 
achieve their fullest potential, irrespective of gender. Moreover, Plato's work contributes to ongoing 
discussions about the representation of women in leadership roles and the importance of dismantling 
structural barriers to equality. 
 
In summary, while Plato's ideas on gender equality were undoubtedly progressive for his time, they also reflect 
the complexities and contradictions of his broader philosophical project. Nevertheless, his recognition of 
women's potential to contribute equally to society's highest echelons remains a significant contribution to the 
discourse on gender and equality, offering insights that continue to resonate in contemporary debates on 
feminism, education, and governance.

Aristotle 
 

Q.1) “The State is a creation of nature and man is by nature a political animal.” (Aristotle) (2011) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Aristotle's view that humans are inherently political beings and that the state is a natural 

extension of human existence, as explored in his work "Politics." 
Body:  
• Discuss Aristotle's development of the concept that the state evolves naturally from smaller community 

associations and is essential for achieving human flourishing and the highest good. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the lasting impact of Aristotle’s ideas on the role of the state and its formative potential in 

enhancing communal life and individual potential, highlighting their relevance to contemporary political 
theory debates. 

 
Aristotle's assertion that "The State is a creation of nature and man is by nature a political animal" is a 
foundational concept in Western political philosophy, reflecting his view on the inherent social and political 
nature of human beings. This statement encapsulates his belief that political association is not just a matter 
of human convention or agreement, but a fundamental aspect of human nature and necessity for achieving a 
good life. 
 
In Aristotle's work, particularly in "Politics," he elaborates on the idea that humans are naturally inclined to 
form communities and governance structures. He argues that the state (polis) arises naturally from the basic 
human associations—the first being the family, then the village, and finally the state, which he considers the 
highest form of community capable of achieving the highest good. According to Aristotle, "It is clear that the 
state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal." He emphasizes that the state exists 
by nature because humans, more than any other creature, possess the faculties of speech and reason which 
enable them to discern good from evil, just from unjust, and to convey such concepts, fostering moral and 
ethical communal living. 
 
Aristotle’s concept of humans as "political animals" suggests that living in a state is essential for full human 
flourishing. He argues that while it is possible to live without a state, those who are without it, not by choice 
but by circumstance, are either sub-human or super-human—like a beast or a god. This stems from his notion 
that human beings are meant to live in a polis, where they can actualize their potential through participation 
in civic life. 
 
His view also implies that the state's role is not merely coercive but primarily formative; it should cultivate the 
good life and virtues among its citizens. This contrasts sharply with modern individualistic approaches to the 
state, which often prioritize individual rights and freedoms over the communal or collective good. 
 
Aristotle's ideas about the naturalness of the state and political nature of humans have had a lasting impact 
on Western political thought. They provide a lens through which to view the state not just as a necessary evil,

a protector of individual rights, or an enforcer of law, but as a natural institution that has potential to 
contribute positively to human life, enabling individuals to achieve their fullest potential through community 
life. 
 
In modern discussions, these ideas continue to resonate as scholars and political theorists debate the role of 
government in regulating social life and promoting public good. Aristotle's perspective encourages a view of 
politics as a deeply integrated aspect of human life and a critical arena for achieving moral and ethical 
development. This classical understanding invites ongoing exploration into how best to balance personal 
freedom with communal responsibility in contemporary governance models. 
 

Q.2) Everywhere, inequality is a cause of revolution- Aristotle. Comment. (2017) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Highlight Aristotle’s assertion that inequality leads to revolution, as discussed in his work "Politics," 

focusing on how justice plays a crucial role in maintaining social harmony. 
Body:  
• Explore Aristotle’s differentiation between distributive and corrective justice, and analyze how different 

political systems handle inequalities that may lead to revolutions, including his views on the causes and 
effects of these inequalities. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the relevance of Aristotle’s insights into modern societal issues, emphasizing the 

importance of equitable justice in preventing political instability and fostering societal harmony. 
 
Aristotle's observation that "Everywhere, inequality is a cause of revolution" underscores his deep 
understanding of the social dynamics that lead to political instability and change. This perspective is articulated 
within the broader context of his political philosophy, notably in his seminal work, "Politics," where he 
examines the structures of different political systems and the conditions under which they thrive or falter. 
Aristotle's analysis of revolutions emerges from his nuanced view of justice and the role it plays in maintaining 
social harmony and political order. 
 
For Aristotle, the concept of justice is central to the functioning of a polity, and inequality represents a 
deviation from this ideal, breeding discontent and, ultimately, leading to revolution. He distinguished between 
two forms of justice: distributive and corrective. Distributive justice concerns the fair allocation of resources 
within a society, while corrective justice deals with rectifying wrongs and injustices. Inequality, in Aristotle's 
view, often stems from failures in distributive justice, where the allocation of wealth, honor, and other societal 
goods does not reflect the merit or contribution of individuals to the community. 
 
Aristotle recognized that different political systems have varying susceptibilities to revolution, largely 
depending on how well they manage the issue of inequality. For instance, democracies might face revolutions 
when the poor, constituting the majority, feel aggrieved by excessive wealth in the hands of a few, leading to 
demands for wealth redistribution. Conversely, oligarchies, where power is concentrated among the wealthy, 
might be destabilized by the disenfranchised poor seeking greater representation and fairness.

Moreover, Aristotle argued that not only material inequality but also perceived injustices in honor and 
recognition could lead to revolutions. When individuals or groups feel that their contributions are undervalued 
or that they are not accorded the respect and status they deserve, it can foster resentment and drive 
revolutionary fervor. Thus, Aristotle’s analysis encompasses a broad understanding of inequality, including 
disparities in wealth, power, honor, and justice. 
 
In contemporary society, Aristotle's insights remain profoundly relevant. The rise of social movements and 
political upheavals across the globe often find their roots in various forms of inequality, whether economic, 
racial, gender-based, or otherwise. Modern political theorists and sociologists continue to explore the ways in 
which inequality undermines social cohesion and prompts demands for systemic change. 
 
Aristotle's assertion invites us to consider the importance of striving for a more equitable distribution of 
resources, opportunities, and recognition within societies. It also highlights the need for political systems to 
be adaptable and responsive to the grievances of their citizens to prevent the descent into instability and 
conflict. In essence, Aristotle's observation on inequality and revolution emphasizes the timeless significance 
of justice as the cornerstone of a stable and harmonious society. 
 

Q.3) Explain the Aristotelian view of politics. To what extent do you think it has contributed to the 
development of modern-day constitutional democracies? (2021) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Aristotle's practical and empirical examination of politics in "Politics," contrasting with Plato's 

idealistic approach, and emphasizing Aristotle's focus on the state's role in promoting the good life. 
Body:  
• Discuss Aristotle’s views on the natural formation of the polis, his categorization of governments, his 

advocacy for a mixed constitution, and the importance of the rule of law, illustrating how these ideas 
contribute to good governance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the enduring impact of Aristotle's political theories on modern constitutional democracies, 

highlighting how his principles of law, mixed government, and state responsibility towards citizens' 
welfare continue to influence contemporary political frameworks. 

 
Aristotle's view of politics, as outlined in his work "Politics," offers a comprehensive examination of the city-
state (polis) and its role in facilitating the highest form of community life. Unlike his teacher Plato, who 
envisioned an ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings in "The Republic," Aristotle adopts a more empirical 
approach, analyzing the constitutions of existing city-states to deduce the principles of good governance. 
Aristotle argues that the state exists to promote the good life for its citizens, which is achievable only within a 
political community that cultivates virtue and enables individuals to fulfill their potential. 
 
Central to the Aristotelian view of politics is the concept of the polis as a natural institution, arising from the 
inherent social nature of humans. Aristotle famously states, "Man is by nature a political animal," emphasizing 
that the polis is essential for achieving a life of virtue and excellence. He differentiates between the types of 
government, categorizing them into six forms, based on whether they serve the common good or the interest

of the rulers: kingship (monarchy), aristocracy, and polity (constitutional government) are considered good 
forms, while tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy (as direct rule by the mob) are seen as their corrupt 
counterparts. 
 
Aristotle's preference for a mixed constitution, which he describes as a polity, reflects his belief in balancing 
elements of democracy and oligarchy to create a stable and just government. This form of government aims 
to harness the virtues of the middle class, which Aristotle views as the most stable and least likely to resort to 
factionalism. His advocacy for the rule of law and the importance of a constitution in regulating the affairs of 
the state further underscores his commitment to rational and moderate governance. 
 
Aristotle's political philosophy has significantly contributed to the development of modern-day constitutional 
democracies in several ways. First, his emphasis on the rule of law as a cornerstone of good governance has 
influenced the constitutional frameworks that define and limit the powers of government in modern 
democracies. The principle that the law should govern, and everyone (including rulers) is subject to the law, is 
a fundamental aspect of constitutional democracies. 
 
Second, Aristotle's idea of a mixed constitution has echoed through the ages, influencing the development of 
systems of checks and balances that are characteristic of contemporary constitutional democracies. The 
blending of democratic and oligarchic elements is mirrored in the structure of modern democratic institutions, 
where representative democracy combines elements of popular participation with protections against the 
tyranny of the majority. 
 
Third, Aristotle's notion that the state exists to promote the good life for its citizens, facilitating their moral 
and intellectual development, resonates with the modern democratic ideal of promoting the welfare of all 
citizens. This idea underpins the democratic commitment to public education, healthcare, and welfare systems 
that aim to improve the quality of life and ensure that every individual has the opportunity to achieve their 
potential. 
 
In conclusion, while Aristotle could not have anticipated the complex realities of 21st-century constitutional 
democracies, his political philosophy has laid foundational principles that continue to influence modern 
political thought and practice. The Aristotelian emphasis on the rule of law, mixed constitution, and the role 
of the state in promoting human flourishing has contributed significantly to the development and 
conceptualization of constitutional democracies around the world.

Q.4) Explain how Machiavelli's application of empirical method to human affairs marks an important stage 
in the evolution of political science. (2014) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Niccolò Machiavelli's shift from philosophical idealism to empirical analysis in political theory, 

emphasizing his pragmatic approach in "The Prince." 
Body:  
• Discuss Machiavelli’s methodology of using historical and contemporary examples to derive political 

principles, his pragmatic views on leadership, and his insights into human nature, which inform his 
advice to rulers. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Machiavelli's impact on the development of political science as a discipline that incorporates 

a realistic understanding of politics and human behavior, highlighting his lasting influence across various 
fields. 

 
Niccolò Machiavelli's application of the empirical method to human affairs represents a significant milestone 
in the development of political science as a discipline. Prior to Machiavelli, much of political theory was rooted 
in philosophical idealism, focusing on how states and societies ought to be organized based on ethical or moral 
principles. Machiavelli's approach, most notably in his seminal work "The Prince" (1532), diverged sharply 
from this tradition. He sought to analyze politics as it is, rather than as it should be, grounding his observations 
in the empirical reality of political life and behavior. This shift towards a more pragmatic and realistic 
examination of politics is why Machiavelli is often regarded as the father of modern political science. 
 
Machiavelli's empirical method involved the careful observation and analysis of historical and contemporary 
political events. He drew extensively on the history of ancient Rome, as well as the tumultuous politics of his 
own time in the Italian city-states, to derive general principles about political power, statecraft, and leadership. 
Machiavelli wrote, "Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times," reflecting 
his view that political action must be based on the concrete circumstances and dynamics of the moment, 
rather than on abstract or eternal principles. 
 
One of Machiavelli's key contributions to political science is his discussion of the qualities of effective rulers. 
He argued that, while it is desirable for a prince to be virtuous, he must also be willing to act immorally when 
the preservation of the state necessitates it. Machiavelli's famous dictum that it is better to be feared than 
loved if one cannot be both encapsulates his break from the idealistic tradition, emphasizing the importance 
of pragmatism and effectiveness over moral perfection in political leadership. 
 
Moreover, Machiavelli's work demonstrates an acute understanding of human nature, which he saw as driven 
by self-interest, ambition, and the desire for power. This cynical view of human motivations informed his 
advice to rulers on how to acquire, maintain, and expand power, underscoring the importance of adaptability, 
strategic planning, and the judicious use of force. By focusing on the realities of human behavior and the 
practicalities of governance, Machiavelli laid the groundwork for the development of political science as an 
empirical, analytical discipline.

Machiavelli's influence extends beyond the realm of political science, impacting the development of various 
fields, including psychology, sociology, and international relations. His empirical approach to the study of 
politics, emphasizing observation, analysis, and the adaptation of strategies to changing circumstances, 
remains a cornerstone of political science research and methodology. 
 
In conclusion, Niccolò Machiavelli's application of the empirical method to human affairs marked a significant 
departure from the idealistic traditions of political thought that preceded him. By grounding his analysis in the 
practical realities of political life and behavior, Machiavelli contributed to the transformation of political theory 
into a discipline that seeks to understand the world as it is. His work represents an important stage in the 
evolution of political science, laying the foundations for the development of a more analytical and pragmatic 
approach to the study of politics. 
 

Q.5) Aristotle’s conception of equality. (2015) (10) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Aristotle's conception of equality, emphasizing his distinction between numerical and 

proportional equality and its significance in contemporary discussions on justice. 
Body:  
• Discuss Aristotle's perspective on equality, focusing on his differentiation between treating equals 

equally and unequals unequally in proportion to their differences. Explore how this notion applies to 
Aristotle's teleological view of nature and society and its implications for political organization. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Aristotle's approach to equality, highlighting its enduring influence and the ongoing debate 

it prompts regarding the balance between equality and merit in political life. Acknowledge critiques 
while affirming its foundational contribution to the discourse on justice and society. 

 
Aristotle's conception of equality, articulated in his seminal work "Politics," presents a nuanced understanding 
that continues to influence contemporary discussions on justice and political organization. Unlike modern 
conceptions of equality that often emphasize sameness or uniform treatment across individuals, Aristotle 
distinguishes between two forms of equality: numerical and proportional. This distinction is crucial for 
grasping Aristotle's approach to justice and the organization of society. 
 
Aristotle posits that true justice is not about treating everyone identically (numerical equality) but rather about 
treating equals equally and unequals unequally in proportion to their differences (proportional equality). He 
writes, "justice is thought to be, and is, equality, not, however, for everyone, but only for equals; and justice 
is thought to be, and is, inequality, not, however, for everyone, but only for unequals" (Aristotle, 
"Nicomachean Ethics," V.3). This perspective suggests that fairness and justice require consideration of the 
specific merits, needs, or circumstances of individuals rather than applying a single standard indiscriminately. 
 
Aristotle's approach is deeply embedded in his teleological view of nature and society, where everything has 
a purpose or end (telos). From this standpoint, equality is about facilitating individuals' ability to fulfill their 
purpose and achieve a good life. Therefore, in the context of the polis (city-state), proportional equality

PSIR By Vivek Waghmare  

supports a society where individuals contribute to and partake in the common good according to their capacity 
and merit. 
 
In discussing the distribution of political power, Aristotle further applies his notion of proportional equality. 
He critiques the democratic principle of allocating equal political rights to all citizens regardless of merit, 
advocating instead for a political system that considers the virtue and contribution of individuals to the polis. 
This leads to a preference for a mixed constitution that balances the principles of democracy and oligarchy, 
allowing for a more nuanced distribution of power that reflects the diversity of contributions among citizens. 
 
Critics of Aristotle's conception of equality highlight its potential to justify social hierarchies and inequalities, 
especially in light of his views on natural slavery and the exclusion of women and non-citizens from political 
participation. These critiques underscore the tension between Aristotle's nuanced understanding of equality 
and the modern emphasis on universal human rights and egalitarianism. 
In conclusion, Aristotle's conception of equality, with its emphasis on proportional justice, offers a distinctive 
perspective that values the differentiation of individuals based on virtue and contribution to the common 
good. While his approach has been subject to criticism, especially from a modern standpoint, it remains a 
foundational contribution to the discourse on equality, justice, and the organization of society, prompting 
ongoing debate and reflection on the balance between equality and merit in political life.
