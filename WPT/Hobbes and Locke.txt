Q.1) Comment on Hobbies as an individualist. (2011) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the concept of hobbies as a significant expression of individualism, highlighting their role in 

reflecting personal interests and contributing to individual identity. 
Body:  
• Discuss the philosophical underpinnings of individualism related to hobbies, their psychological 

benefits, and their sociological implications for expressing autonomy and resisting cultural 
homogenization. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of hobbies in personal development and well-being, emphasizing their role 

in fostering a fulfilling life and reinforcing individuality within society. 
 
The concept of hobbies as an expression of individualism is a rich area of exploration within both sociological 
and psychological studies. Hobbies, defined as activities one engages in regularly for pleasure during one's 
leisure time, are often seen as a reflection of one's personal interests, talents, and preferences, thus serving 
as a potent expression of individual identity. 
 
Individualism, a philosophical and cultural notion that emphasizes the moral worth and autonomy of the 
individual, suggests that hobbies are a form of self-expression and personal development. This perspective 
aligns with the ideas of classical liberal thinkers like John Stuart Mill, who in his seminal work "On Liberty," 
championed the importance of individuality as one of the elements of well-being. Mill asserted, "It is only the 
cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings." From this 
viewpoint, hobbies are not merely recreational activities but are critical to the development of one's character 
and capabilities. 
 
Hobbies provide a unique window into how individuals assert their independence and choices, distinct from 
work or family obligations. They offer a space for creativity, relaxation, and satisfaction that might not be 
found in other areas of life, particularly in professional contexts where external demands and pressures can 
limit personal expression. For instance, someone might find solace and a sense of achievement in painting, 
gardening, or coding, which not only adds to their personal joy but also enhances their sense of self. 
 
Psychologically, hobbies are known to have significant benefits, contributing to one’s overall mental health 
and happiness. Studies have shown that engaging in hobbies can lead to decreased stress, lower blood 
pressure, and a lower risk of depression. This aligns with the views of modern psychological theorists like 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who discussed the concept of "flow"—a highly focused mental state conducive to 
productivity—often achieved during engaging hobby activities. Csikszentmihalyi’s research highlights how 
hobbies can fulfill the individual’s innate needs for challenge, learning, and psychological well-being.

Moreover, in a societal context, the choice and pursuit of hobbies can serve as a form of resistance against 
homogenizing forces of consumer culture or authoritarianism, emphasizing how personal choices in leisure 
activities can mirror larger values of freedom and self-determination. This echoes Alexis de Tocqueville’s 
observations in "Democracy in America," where he noted that the arts of pursuit, such as maintaining a garden 
or tinkering with machines, provide democratic citizens with a sense of autonomy and pleasure in their private 
sphere, which is essential for a balanced life. 
 
In conclusion, hobbies as an expression of individualism highlight the importance of personal freedom and 
self-expression in contributing to the overall development and well-being of individuals. They not only enrich 
personal life but also underscore the value of individuality in a collective society. Hobbies encourage a creative 
and fulfilling personal life, reinforcing the idea that personal diversification and independence in leisure can 
lead to a more robust, resilient individual identity. 
 

Q.2) ‘Locke is an individualist out and out’. Substantiate this statement. (2012) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Locke as a pivotal figure in political philosophy, highlighting his deep-rooted 

individualism as reflected in his work, "Two Treatises of Government." 
Body:  
• Discuss Locke's views on the state of nature, individual rights, and the social contract, focusing on how 

these theories underscore his commitment to personal autonomy and the role of government in 
protecting these rights. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how Locke's individualistic philosophy has influenced liberal democratic thought and 

practices, emphasizing his impact on the principles of governance and economic theory. 
 
The characterization of John Locke as "an individualist out and out" is substantiated by his profound 
contributions to political philosophy, particularly through his theories of individual rights, the state of nature, 
and the social contract. Locke's works, notably "Two Treatises of Government," are foundational texts in the 
development of liberal democratic thought, emphasizing the primacy of the individual and the inherent rights 
that belong to each person. 
 
Locke's individualism is most evident in his concept of the state of nature, where he describes a pre-political 
condition characterized by complete personal freedom and equality. According to Locke, in this state, every 
individual has natural rights to life, liberty, and property. He famously stated, "Every man has a property in his 
own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself." This idea underscores Locke's belief in the importance 
of personal autonomy and the intrinsic value of the individual, ideas that form the bedrock of liberal 
individualism. 
 
Furthermore, Locke's theory of government is fundamentally based on the consent of the governed, 
illustrating his commitment to individualism. He argued that political authority is justified only when it serves 
the interests of individuals, primarily the protection of their natural rights. Government, according to Locke,

is a tool created by individuals to safeguard their rights and is conditional on its performance in this role. If a 
government fails to protect these rights or becomes a threat to them, individuals retain the right to alter or 
overthrow it. This principle not only highlights the agency and sovereignty of individuals over collective entities 
like the state but also sets the groundwork for later democratic theories that emphasize individual 
participation and consent as the basis of legitimate political authority. 
 
Locke’s impact on individualism extends beyond political theory into economic thought. His views on property 
are particularly influential, where he discusses the labor theory of property, asserting that property becomes 
an individual’s own when they mix their labor with it. This not only advocates for the sanctity of private 
property but also promotes the freedom of individuals to manage and dispose of their property without 
interference, aligning closely with capitalist principles that value individual initiative and ownership. 
 
Locke's influence on liberal individualism can be seen in the writings of later philosophers and the 
development of liberal democratic states. His ideas were revolutionary at the time and provided a 
philosophical foundation for the Enlightenment and modern political developments, including the American 
Declaration of Independence, which echoes Locke’s emphasis on individual rights and the governance's role 
in their protection. 
 
In conclusion, John Locke’s philosophy robustly supports the view that he was an individualist through and 
through. His theories prioritize the individual’s rights and autonomy, advocate for a government that serves 
at the pleasure of its constituents, and promote a capitalist system of property rights based on personal labor 
and ownership. These principles have made significant impacts on Western political thought, cementing 
Locke’s legacy as a quintessential individualist. 
 

Q.3) Hobbesian notion of Political obligation. Comment (2017) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Thomas Hobbes's perspective on political obligation, emphasizing his social contract theory 

and the role of fear in driving compliance. 
Body:  
• Discuss Hobbes's theory of political obligation, focusing on the social contract, rational self-interest, and 

fear of anarchy as key components. Explain how individuals submit to political authority to escape the 
state of nature and attain security. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Hobbes's theory, acknowledging its influence on political thought while highlighting 

criticisms regarding its reductionist view of political obligation and implications for governance. Reflect 
on ongoing debates about the balance between security and individual liberties in contemporary 
societies. 

 
Thomas Hobbes, a prominent philosopher of the 17th century, introduced a unique perspective on political 
obligation in his renowned work, "Leviathan." His ideas, often termed Hobbesian political obligation, revolve 
around the social contract theory and the role of fear in driving political compliance.

Hobbes posited that political obligation emerges from a social contract, where individuals in the state of nature 
willingly relinquish some of their natural rights and powers to form a commonwealth, with a central authority, 
the Leviathan, to ensure security and prevent the chaos inherent in the state of nature. As Hobbes eloquently 
stated, "A commonwealth is said to be instituted when a multitude of men do agree, and covenant, every 
one with every one, that to whatsoever man, or assembly of men, shall be given by the major part, the right 
to present the person of them all." This contractual agreement forms the basis of political obligation in his 
theory. 
 
Hobbes's notion of political obligation is deeply rooted in rational self-interest. He argued that individuals obey 
political authority not out of moral duty or loyalty but because it serves their best interests. In a state of nature, 
life is characterized by constant conflict and insecurity, leading to a bleak existence. Hobbes famously 
described this condition as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Thus, individuals choose to submit to 
political authority to escape this perilous state and attain security. 
 
A fundamental element of Hobbes's theory is the fear of anarchy. He believed that people obey the state to 
avoid the chaos that would prevail without its authority. This fear of the state of nature, characterized by the 
absence of a common power to keep individuals in check, is a powerful motivator for political compliance. 
 
Hobbes's theory does recognize that political authority is derived from the consent of individuals. However, 
this consent is given once, at the inception of the social contract when individuals agree to establish the 
commonwealth. Hobbes does not advocate for ongoing, explicit acts of consent as the basis for political 
obligation. 
 
While Hobbes's theory provides a compelling account of political obligation grounded in self-interest and fear, 
it has not been without criticism. Scholars have argued that reducing political obligation solely to rational self-
interest overlooks moral and ethical dimensions of governance. Furthermore, Hobbes's authoritarian 
implications have raised concerns about the potential justification of oppressive regimes if they claim to 
provide security. 
 
Hobbes's notion of political obligation is characterized by the social contract, rational self-interest, and the 
fear of anarchy. Individuals obey the state to escape the state of nature and attain security. While his ideas 
have significantly influenced political thought, they have also generated debates regarding the moral and 
ethical aspects of governance and the potential for authoritarianism. 
 

Q.4)  “Covenants without swords are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all.” (Hobbes)

conflict in Hobbes' philosophy.

• Discuss Hobbes' argument for the necessity of political authority to escape the chaos of the state of 
nature, emphasizing the role of covenants and the coercive power of the sovereign, as outlined in 
"Leviathan." Incorporate insights from scholars like A.P. Martinich to deepen understanding. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Hobbes' perspective, emphasizing the importance of a strong political authority, or 

"Leviathan," for maintaining social order and security. Reflect on the enduring relevance of Hobbes' 
ideas in contemporary discussions of political authority and the social contract. 

 
Thomas Hobbes' political philosophy, as expounded in his seminal work "Leviathan," commences with a 
contemplation of the state of nature, a hypothetical condition devoid of organized political authority. Within 
this state, individuals, according to Hobbes, are driven by intrinsic self-interest, as emphasized by political 
philosopher Jean Hampton, who highlighted the centrality of self-preservation and personal interests in 
Hobbes' worldview. In the absence of external restraints, humans are trapped in a perpetual cycle of rivalry 
and discord, a view echoed by political theorist Deborah Baumgold, who emphasized the competitive and 
conflict-ridden nature of the state of nature. 
 
To escape the perils of this chaotic state, Hobbes contends that individuals would naturally engage in the 
formation of covenants or agreements. These covenants can take various forms, including social contracts or 
commitments to establish a shared authority. Their primary purpose is to create societal order, ensure 
security, and establish a framework of justice.  
 
However, Hobbes is quick to emphasize that verbal agreements alone lack the strength to maintain social 
harmony. In the absence of a credible, coercive power capable of enforcing these agreements, individuals 
have little incentive to honor their promises. Hobbes' famous characterization of life in the state of nature as 
"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short," as mentioned in "Leviathan," vividly underscores the chaos and 
insecurity that pervade this hypothetical scenario. 
 
Thus, Hobbes underscores his central thesis that a robust sovereign political authority is imperative for the 
preservation of peace and security in society. The "sword" serves as a symbol for the coercive power vested 
in the state, encompassing its capacity to uphold laws, maintain order, and safeguard individuals from harm. 
In the absence of this authoritative power, covenants and agreements remain ineffectual, incapable of 
ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals. 
 
Hobbes likens this vital political authority to a "Leviathan," an all-encompassing and potent government. He 
contends that individuals must surrender a portion of their innate rights and consent to the jurisdiction of the 
Leviathan. In return, they receive protection and relief from the tumultuous state of nature. As pointed out by 
political philosopher A.P. Martinich, Hobbes' Leviathan represents the embodiment of sovereign power, 
ensuring the stability and security of civil society. 
 
Thomas Hobbes' statement vividly illustrates the precariousness of verbal agreements and reinforces the 
critical role of a strong political authority in maintaining social order. It encapsulates his core belief that 
without a coercive power to enforce covenants, human society would plunge into perpetual conflict and 
insecurity. The establishment of a potent government, or "Leviathan," is, in Hobbes' view, the fundamental 
prerequisite for the well-being and survival of individuals within a society. His ideas continue to be a 
foundational element in discussions of political authority and the social contract.

Q.5) “How would I and my fellow human beings behave if we were to find ourselves in a state of nature, and 

what does this behavior tell us about our innate predispositions?” (Hobbes) Comment (2016) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Thomas Hobbes and his work "Leviathan," highlighting his perspective on human nature and 

the state of nature as foundational to his political theory. 
Body:  
• Discuss Hobbes's grim portrayal of the state of nature, emphasizing human self-interest and the 

absence of authority, leading to perpetual conflict. Explore his argument for the necessity of a social 
contract to escape this condition, surrendering freedoms for security under a powerful sovereign, the 
Leviathan. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Hobbes's view on human behavior and political authority, acknowledging critiques while 

affirming his lasting influence on political philosophy. Reflect on the enduring relevance of his ideas in 
understanding social order and the role of the state. 

 
Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, offers a distinctive answer to the question of human 
behavior in the state of nature and its implications for our innate predispositions in his seminal work, 
"Leviathan" (1651). Hobbes's perspective on human nature and the state of nature is foundational to his 
political theory, arguing that in a pre-political state of nature, human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, 
brutish, and short." This bleak outlook on the state of nature is rooted in Hobbes's view of human beings as 
fundamentally motivated by self-interest and the desire for self-preservation. 
 
According to Hobbes, in the state of nature, there is no authority or law to mediate disputes, leading to a 
condition of perpetual conflict and war of "every man against every man." This perpetual state of warfare 
arises from three principal causes: competition (for limited resources), diffidence (for safety), and glory (for 
reputation). He writes, "In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: 
and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported 
by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; 
no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst 
of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." 
 
From Hobbes's perspective, the natural state of constant warfare and insecurity reveals an innate 
predisposition towards self-preservation and rational self-interest, where individuals are willing to fight to 
secure their survival and well-being. However, recognizing the intolerable nature of this perpetual conflict, 
Hobbes argues that rational individuals would seek to escape the state of nature by forming a social contract, 
mutually agreeing to surrender some of their freedoms to a sovereign authority in exchange for protection 
and the maintenance of social order. This sovereign, whether an individual or an assembly, wields absolute 
power to enforce laws and ensure peace, embodying the concept of Leviathan, a powerful state that curbs 
natural human instincts and behaviors for the collective good.

Hobbes's analysis of human behavior in the state of nature and the subsequent formation of a social contract 
has profound implications for understanding political authority, the nature of human rights, and the 
justification of state power. His assertion that the fear of violent death motivates individuals to establish 
political societies underlines his belief in the necessity of absolute sovereignty to prevent the chaos and 
violence inherent in the state of nature. 
 
Critics of Hobbes have challenged his pessimistic view of human nature and the necessity of absolute 
sovereignty, arguing for more optimistic assessments of human predispositions and advocating for democratic 
or limited forms of government. Despite these critiques, Hobbes's theories remain influential in political 
philosophy, offering a compelling framework for examining the foundations of social order and the role of the 
state in ensuring peace and security. 
 
In conclusion, Thomas Hobbes's reflection on human behavior in the state of nature underscores his belief in 
innate human predispositions towards self-interest and conflict, justifying the establishment of a powerful 
state as the guarantor of peace and social cohesion. His work remains a cornerstone of political theory, 
providing valuable insights into the nature of human beings, the origins of society, and the justification of 
political authority. 
 

Q.6) John Locke is the father of liberalism. Explain (2018) (20 marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Locke as a pivotal figure in the Enlightenment and the "Father of Liberalism." Mention 

his influential work "Two Treatises of Government" and outline his key contributions to liberal political 
thought. 

Body:  
• Discuss Locke's ideas on natural rights, social contract theory, limited government, religious tolerance, 

empiricism, and reason. Highlight how each concept shaped the foundation of liberalism and influenced 
modern democratic governance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Locke's legacy as a foundational thinker of liberalism, emphasizing his enduring impact on 

political philosophy and contemporary democratic societies. Reflect on how his ideas continue to shape 
principles of individual freedom, limited government, and human rights. 

 
John Locke, often referred to as the "Father of Liberalism," stands as a central figure in the development of 
liberal political thought during the Enlightenment. His influential ideas, prominently featured in his work "Two 
Treatises of Government" (1689), laid the intellectual foundation for many of the core principles of liberalism. 
Locke's key contributions to liberal thought can be summarized as follows: 
 
First and foremost, Locke introduced the concept of natural rights, encompassing the rights to life, liberty, and 
property. He posited that these rights are intrinsic to every individual by virtue of their humanity and that no 
governing authority possesses the legitimacy to infringe upon them. This foundational idea remains at the 
heart of liberal ideology, emphasizing the protection of individual freedoms from undue government 
intervention.

Locke further introduced the social contract theory, proposing that individuals engage in a mutual agreement 
to establish civil society and government. This social contract is built upon the shared recognition of natural 
rights and the collective pursuit of security and general well-being. Locke's vision of consensual government 
laid the groundwork for the principles of limited government and the notion that political authority should be 
contingent upon the consent of the governed. 
 
In his writings, Locke passionately advocated for governments with well-defined and constrained powers, 
whose primary purpose is to safeguard the natural rights of their citizens. He staunchly rejected the notions 
of absolute monarchy and divine right, championing the idea that governments derive their legitimacy solely 
from the consent of the governed. This fundamental concept forms the bedrock of constitutionalism and the 
division of powers, both of which are integral aspects of liberal political systems. 
 
Furthermore, Locke's treatise "Letter Concerning Toleration" (1689) made a significant impact by advocating 
for religious tolerance and the separation of church and state. He argued that religious beliefs should never 
be imposed by force and that individuals possess the unalienable right to worship in accordance with their 
conscience. This standpoint greatly influenced the development of religious freedom and secularism within 
liberal democracies. 
Locke's status as an empiricist who believed in the acquisition of human knowledge through sensory 
experience and reason underscored the significance of critical thinking and the pursuit of knowledge. His 
emphasis on empiricism and rational inquiry aligned perfectly with the broader Enlightenment values of 
reason, scientific inquiry, and intellectual progress. 
 
Lastly, Locke's ideas had a profound and lasting impact on subsequent liberal philosophers and political 
leaders, including luminaries like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Montesquieu, Thomas Jefferson, and the framers of 
the American Constitution. His works provided the intellectual underpinnings for the American Revolution and 
the establishment of democratic, liberal governments. 
 
John Locke's contributions to political philosophy, including his development of the concept of natural rights, 
his social contract theory, his advocacy for limited government, religious tolerance, empiricism, and reason, 
solidify his legacy as the "Father of Liberalism." His ideas continue to shape modern liberal democratic 
societies and exert a significant influence on contemporary political thought and governance.

• Discuss Locke's rejection of divine right monarchy, advocacy for government by consent, emphasis on 
natural rights (life, liberty, property), and introduction of the separation of powers. Explore how these 
ideas have influenced liberal democratic thought and governance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Locke's enduring legacy as a champion of liberalism, whose ideas have revolutionized 

political theory and inspired democratic movements worldwide. Reflect on his contributions to 
individual freedom, equality, and the rule of law in modern liberal democracies. 

 
John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, is often hailed as the "father of liberalism" due to his 
influential contributions to the development of liberal political philosophy. His seminal works, particularly 
"Two Treatises of Government" (1689), laid the foundational principles for modern liberal democracy, 
emphasizing the importance of individual rights, the rule of law, and government by consent. 
 
Locke's political philosophy was a response to the authoritarian rule and the divine right of kings prevalent in 
his time. He argued against the notion that monarchs had a God-given right to govern and instead posited that 
political authority is derived from the consent of the governed. This was a revolutionary idea that shifted the 
basis of government legitimacy to the social contract—a voluntary agreement among individuals to form a 
society and a government to protect their rights. Locke famously stated, "Men being...by nature all free, equal 
and independent, no one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the political power of another, without 
his own consent." 
 
Central to Locke's liberalism is the emphasis on natural rights—life, liberty, and property. He argued that 
individuals inherently possess these rights, and the primary role of government is to protect them. This 
concept of natural rights has become a cornerstone of liberal democratic thought, influencing the formulation 
of fundamental rights and liberties in constitutional democracies around the world. 
 
Locke also introduced the idea of the separation of powers within government, advocating for a division 
between the legislative (responsible for making laws), the executive (responsible for implementing laws), and 
the federative (dealing with foreign affairs and war). This separation was intended to prevent the 
concentration of power and to provide a system of checks and balances, further ensuring the protection of 
individual rights. 
 
Locke's influence extends beyond political theory to the realms of epistemology and education, advocating for 
tolerance, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge. However, it is his contributions to liberalism that have left 
an enduring legacy. His ideas were revolutionary in challenging the existing order and laid the groundwork for 
the Enlightenment and subsequent democratic revolutions, notably influencing the American Declaration of 
Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. 
 
Despite criticisms regarding his views on property and consent, which some argue do not sufficiently account 
for the realities of inequality and coercion, Locke's vision of a government based on the consent of the 
governed, dedicated to protecting individual rights, and governed by laws made by representatives, remains 
central to liberal democratic ideals. 
 
In conclusion, John Locke's designation as the "father of liberalism" is well-founded, given his profound impact 
on the development of liberal thought. His work not only challenged the authoritarianism of his own time but

also provided a blueprint for a more just and equitable society, emphasizing freedom, equality, and

Q.8) Locke is an individualist out and out’. Substantiate this statement (20 Marks) (2012) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the assertion that John Locke is an individualist, focusing on his philosophical contributions 

and their implications for individual rights and autonomy. 
Body:  
• Discuss Locke's theories of natural rights, the state of nature, and government, emphasizing their 

alignment with individualism. Explore how Locke's emphasis on individual autonomy and rights 
influences his views on property, the social contract, and the limitation of government powers. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Locke's individualist philosophy and its impact on liberal thought and democratic 

governance. Highlight how Locke's ideas continue to shape modern liberal democracies, underscoring 
the enduring relevance of his principles of individual liberty and rights. 

 
 
The assertion that John Locke is "an individualist out and out" can be substantiated by examining his 
philosophical contributions, particularly his theories of natural rights, the state of nature, and government. 
Locke's work, most notably in "Two Treatises of Government" (1689), lays the groundwork for liberal 
individualism, emphasizing the importance of individual rights, consent of the governed, and the limitation of 
government powers. 
 
Locke's individualism is first evident in his concept of the state of nature, a pre-political condition where 
individuals live in perfect freedom and equality. In this state, every person possesses the natural right to life, 
liberty, and property. Locke states, "The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every 
one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and 
independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions." This articulation of 
natural rights underscores the inherent value and autonomy of the individual, laying the foundation for his 
individualist philosophy. 
 
Furthermore, Locke's theory of property is intrinsically linked to individual labor and the rights of individuals 
to the fruits of their labor. He argues that property is created when an individual mixes their labor with nature, 
transforming natural resources into goods that reflect the individual's effort and thus belong to them. This 
concept reinforces the notion of individual rights and autonomy, suggesting that individuals have a natural 
and inalienable right to the products of their labor. 
 
Locke's individualism is also manifest in his political theory, particularly his views on the social contract and 
government. Unlike Thomas Hobbes, who advocated for absolute sovereignty as a solution to the state of 
nature, Locke posits that individuals consent to form a government to protect their natural rights. The 
legitimacy of government, therefore, derives from its ability to safeguard the rights of individuals, and its 
power is limited to the consent of the governed. Should the government fail to protect these rights, individuals

retain the right to revolt and establish a new government. This emphasis on consent and the right to resistance 
highlights Locke's commitment to individual autonomy and self-determination. 
 
Locke's individualism has had a profound impact on the development of liberal thought and democratic 
governance. His ideas on natural rights, property, and the social contract have influenced the formation of 
modern liberal democracies, evident in foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence of the 
United States. The emphasis on individual liberty, equality before the law, and the protection of private 
property remains central to liberal democratic ideals. 
 
In conclusion, John Locke's philosophical contributions substantiate the claim that he is "an individualist out 
and out." His theories of natural rights, property, and government articulate a vision of human society that 
prioritizes individual freedom, autonomy, and the protection of individual rights. Locke's work not only shaped 
the contours of liberal individualism but also laid the philosophical foundation for the principles and practices 
of contemporary liberal democracies. 
 

Q.9) Comment on Locke’s Social Contract (2022) (10) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Locke and his influential theory of the social contract, emphasizing its significance in 

political theory and its historical context. 
Body:  
• Explore Locke's social contract theory, focusing on key elements such as natural rights, government by 

consent, the right to rebellion, and the role of property. Discuss how these concepts shaped Locke's 
vision of a just society and influenced the development of modern democratic governance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Locke's enduring impact on political thought, highlighting how his social contract theory 

continues to inform contemporary debates on democracy, individual rights, and the legitimate exercise 
of political authority. 

 
John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher, made seminal contributions to political theory through his 
development of the social contract theory, most notably articulated in his works "Two Treatises of 
Government" (1689). Locke's theory of the social contract emerged as a response to the absolute monarchies 
of his time and laid the groundwork for modern democratic thought. His ideas were revolutionary, 
emphasizing natural rights, government by consent, and the right of rebellion against unjust rulers. 
 
Locke's social contract is founded on the premise that individuals possess natural rights to life, liberty, and 
property in the state of nature—a pre-political state where humans live without a common authority. 
However, the state of nature, while generally peaceful, is plagued by insecurities and threats to property. To 
safeguard these natural rights and ensure impartial justice, individuals mutually agree to form a society and 
establish a government. This consent forms the basis of political legitimacy. 
 
Central to Locke's theory is the idea of consent. Unlike Thomas Hobbes, who envisioned a social contract that 
conferred absolute power on a sovereign, Locke argued for a form of government where authority is derived

from the consent of the governed. For Locke, "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed." This principle not only legitimizes government authority but also 
stipulates that such authority must be exercised for the common good, protecting the natural rights of citizens. 
 
Locke also introduced the concept of the right to rebellion. He posited that if a government fails to protect the 
natural rights of its citizens or acts against their interests, the social contract is broken, and the people have 
the right, even the duty, to resist and establish a new government. This aspect of Locke's theory was 
particularly influential, inspiring later political movements, including the American Revolution. 
 
The idea of property holds a special place in Locke's social contract theory. He argued that property is a natural 
right, derived from an individual's labor. The protection of property, therefore, becomes a primary function of 
government. Locke's emphasis on property as a cornerstone of liberty and as a justification for the 
establishment of government was a significant departure from previous thinkers and had a profound impact 
on liberal political thought. 
 
Locke's social contract theory significantly contributed to the development of modern constitutional 
democracies. His ideas on natural rights, government by consent, the separation of powers, and the right to 
rebellion against tyrannical rule influenced the framing of democratic constitutions around the world, 
including the United States Constitution. 
 
In contemporary discussions, Locke's social contract theory remains relevant, offering insights into debates on 
human rights, governance, and the role of the state in protecting individual freedoms and ensuring social 
justice. While the contexts have changed, the core principles of Locke's theory—consent, natural rights, and 
the legitimate bases of political authority—continue to inform our understanding of the moral and legal 
foundations of democratic societies. 
 
In summary, Locke's social contract theory marks a pivotal moment in the history of political thought, 
advocating for a form of government that respects individual rights and is accountable to the people. His 
contributions provide a philosophical basis for the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of 
law, underscoring the enduring significance of Locke's ideas in shaping modern political discourse.

• Summarize Hobbes's philosophy, noting the tension between individualism and absolutism. Highlight 
the significance of Hobbes's recognition of individual motivations while ultimately advocating for a 
powerful central authority to maintain social order. 

 
Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, is widely recognized for his influential work, "Leviathan" 
(1651), which articulates a comprehensive political philosophy that includes a justification for an absolute 
sovereign authority. While Hobbes is often associated with absolutism due to his advocacy for a sovereign 
power that stands above all to prevent society from descending into chaos, his philosophy also contains 
elements of individualism that are crucial for understanding his overall ideological stance. 
 
Individualism, in the context of Hobbes's philosophy, can be identified in his conceptualization of the state of 
nature and the social contract. Hobbes's state of nature is a hypothetical condition characterized by the 
absence of political authority, in which individuals live in a "war of all against all," where life is "solitary, poor, 
nasty, brutish, and short." In this state, individuals are motivated by rational self-interest and the desire for 
self-preservation. Hobbes writes, "every man has a right to everything, even to one another's body," 
emphasizing the individual's primacy and the natural freedom to use any means necessary to preserve one's 
own life. 
The move from the state of nature to a political society, for Hobbes, is driven by individual rationality and the 
desire to secure a more peaceful and secure existence. This is achieved through the social contract, an 
agreement among individuals to surrender their natural freedoms to a sovereign in exchange for protection 
of their lives and property. The social contract is fundamentally an individualistic act, grounded in the 
recognition of the benefits of cooperation and the establishment of a common power to secure peace and 
survival. 
 
However, Hobbes's individualism does not imply an endorsement of liberal freedoms or democracy. Instead, 
it serves as the foundation for his argument in favor of absolutism. Once the social contract is established, the 
sovereign authority, whether a monarch or an assembly, holds absolute power to ensure peace and security. 
For Hobbes, the relinquishing of individual rights to the sovereign is total, except for the right to self-
preservation. The sovereign's decisions are uncontestable, and the subjects' obligation to obey is 
unconditional, highlighting a tension between Hobbes's recognition of individual motivations and his 
prescription for an absolute form of government. 
 
Critics and scholars have debated Hobbes's views on individualism and absolutism. Some argue that his 
absolutist state negates individualism by subsuming all rights under the will of the sovereign. Others, however, 
see Hobbes's initial acknowledgment of the individual's rationality and rights in the state of nature as an 
important contribution to the development of political individualism, even if his ultimate solution sharply 
diverges from later liberal democratic theories. 
 
In conclusion, while Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy culminates in the advocacy for an absolute 
sovereign authority, it is underpinned by a form of individualism that recognizes the importance of individual 
rationality, self-interest, and the natural rights that individuals possess in the state of nature. This individualism 
is inherent in Hobbes's absolutist ideology, providing the rationale for the establishment of a social contract 
and the surrender of natural freedoms to a sovereign power for the sake of collective security and order.

Q.11) Comment on the assertion of Laslett that Filmer and not Hobbes was the main antagonist of Locke. 
(2013) (10) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Peter Laslett and his assertion regarding John Locke's primary antagonist, challenging the 

conventional view that it was Thomas Hobbes. 
Body:  
• Discuss Sir Robert Filmer's "Patriarcha" and its defense of divine right monarchy, contrasting it with 

Locke's refutation in the "Two Treatises of Government." Emphasize how Laslett's perspective shifts the 
focus from Hobbes to Filmer as Locke's main ideological adversary. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Laslett's argument and its implications for understanding Locke's political philosophy. 

Highlight the significance of recognizing Filmer's influence in shaping Locke's ideas and the broader 
historical context of seventeenth-century political thought. 

 
 
Peter Laslett, a significant figure in historical and political scholarship, notably edited and introduced John 
Locke's "Two Treatises of Government." In his work, Laslett posits that Sir Robert Filmer, rather than Thomas 
Hobbes, was Locke's primary antagonist. This assertion challenges a long-held view that Locke's political 
philosophy was mainly a rebuttal to Hobbes's authoritarianism as articulated in "Leviathan." Instead, Laslett 
points to Filmer's "Patriarcha," which defends the divine right of kings and the absolute authority of monarchs, 
as the key work Locke sought to refute in his "Two Treatises." 
 
Filmer's "Patriarcha" argues that kings possess a God-given authority to rule, derived from Adam, the 
supposed first king and father of humanity. According to Filmer, since all men are descendants of Adam, they 
are naturally subject to the absolute authority of the king, who inherits Adam's paternal power. This 
perspective provides a theological and patriarchal justification for absolute monarchy, asserting that political 
power is neither derived from the consent of the governed nor subject to any conditions or limitations. 
 
Locke's "Two Treatises of Government," especially the First Treatise, is a direct refutation of Filmer's 
arguments. Locke methodically dismantles Filmer's theory, rejecting the notion of divine right and the idea 
that political authority stems from paternal power. Locke argues instead that political power arises from the 
social contract, an agreement among free and equal individuals to form a government that protects their 
natural rights to life, liberty, and property. For Locke, government is legitimate only if it serves the interests of 
the governed and preserves their rights, and it must always be accountable to the people. 
 
Laslett's emphasis on Filmer as Locke's main antagonist highlights the context in which Locke was writing. 
While Hobbes's work certainly influenced the intellectual landscape of the time, Locke's immediate concern 
was countering the arguments that directly supported the existing structure of monarchical power and 
justified absolute rule without consent. In this light, Filmer's defense of absolute monarchy based on divine 
right and paternal authority represented a more direct challenge to the principles Locke sought to establish: 
individual rights, consent, and the idea of government as a protector rather than a proprietor of men's lives 
and freedoms.

In conclusion, Peter Laslett's assertion that Sir Robert Filmer, and not Thomas Hobbes, was the main 
antagonist of John Locke, refocuses our understanding of Locke's political motivations and the historical 
context of his writings. By identifying Filmer's "Patriarcha" as the primary target of Locke's "Two Treatises," 
Laslett illuminates the specific ideological battles Locke was engaging with. This perspective helps us 
appreciate the radical nature of Locke's contributions to political philosophy, particularly his rejection of divine 
right monarchy and his advocacy for a government based on the consent of the governed and the protection 
of natural rights. 
 
 

Q.12) State of Nature as State of War (Hobbes). (10 Marks) (2023) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Thomas Hobbes and his seminal work "Leviathan," highlighting his depiction of the state of 

nature as a condition of perpetual conflict and fear. 
Body:  
• Discuss Hobbes's characterization of the state of nature, emphasizing the absence of government, the 

prevalence of self-interest, and the resulting state of war among individuals. Describe his proposed 
solution through the establishment of a social contract and the sovereign Leviathan to maintain peace 
and order. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance of Hobbes's analysis, acknowledging both its influence on political theory 

and the ongoing debates it sparks regarding human nature, governance, and the trade-offs between 
individual freedom and collective security. 

 
Thomas Hobbes, a seminal figure in political philosophy, offers a distinctive and influential perspective on the 
state of nature in his work, "Leviathan" (1651). Hobbes describes the state of nature as a hypothetical 
condition that exists prior to the establishment of a political society, characterized by an absence of 
government, law, or moral restraint. In this state, individuals possess absolute freedom and equality, yet this 
very freedom leads to a condition Hobbes famously describes as a "war of every man against every man." 
 
Hobbes's depiction of the state of nature is grounded in a pessimistic view of human nature. He posits that 
humans are motivated primarily by self-interest and a desire for self-preservation, which, in the absence of a 
common power to impose order, inevitably leads to conflict over resources, security, and prestige. Hobbes 
famously asserts, "In such condition, there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and 
consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; 
no commodious building; no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no 
knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of 
all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." 
 
The state of nature as a state of war is not just a physical war but a psychological condition of constant fear 
and readiness for conflict. This perpetual state of war arises not only from actual conflicts but also from the

general mistrust among individuals, where everyone must be prepared to defend themselves against potential 
threats. 
 
Hobbes's solution to this dire condition is the establishment of a social contract, wherein individuals 
collectively agree to surrender their natural freedoms to a sovereign authority (the Leviathan) in exchange for 
security and order. The sovereign, endowed with absolute power, ensures peace and stability through the 
enforcement of laws, thus overcoming the anarchic tendencies of the state of nature. For Hobbes, the absolute 
power of the Leviathan is justified as the only viable means to prevent the return to the state of nature's 
intolerable conditions. 
 
Hobbes's conception of the state of nature as a state of war has been both influential and contentious. Critics 
argue that Hobbes's pessimistic view of human nature overlooks the capacity for cooperation, altruism, and 
social bonds that can exist even in the absence of a central authority. Others have questioned the desirability 
of absolute sovereignty as a solution, suggesting that it risks replacing the anarchy of the state of nature with 
the tyranny of an unchecked ruler. 
 
Despite these critiques, Hobbes's analysis of the state of nature remains a foundational contribution to 
political theory, raising enduring questions about human nature, the origins of social order, and the 
justification of political authority. His work continues to influence contemporary debates on governance, 
security, and the balance between individual freedom and collective safety.
