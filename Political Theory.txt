1 Political Theory: Meaning and its approaches 
 

Q.1) Examine the significance of the behavioural revolution in politics. (2011) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Highlight the significance of the Behavioral Revolution in reshaping political science towards empirical 

analysis of individual behavior in political systems. 
Body:  
• Discuss key scholars like David Easton and Robert Dahl, who pioneered this shift, and how their works 

emphasized empirical methodologies and challenged traditional normative approaches. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the impact of the Behavioral Revolution, noting its contribution to a deeper understanding 

of political phenomena while acknowledging criticisms regarding its potential limitations in overlooking 
institutional and structural factors. 

 
The Behavioral Revolution in political science, which began to take shape in the 1950s and 1960s, represents 
a pivotal shift in the study and understanding of political dynamics. This transformation was marked by a move 
from normative and philosophical inquiries into government and political ideas towards a more empirical, 
scientific approach focused on the behaviors and actions of individuals within political systems. 
 
Pioneering scholars like David Easton, Robert Dahl, and Gabriel Almond were instrumental in this shift. 
Easton's work, particularly his system theory in "The Political System" published in 1953, argued for the 
analysis of political systems as complex sets of interactions among inputs and outputs, emphasizing empirical 
data and behavioral relationships. Robert Dahl’s "A Preface to Democratic Theory" (1956) expanded this 
perspective by exploring political opposition and its role in democratic frameworks, stressing the importance 
of empirical research on political behavior to understand democratic durability. 
 
The significance of the Behavioral Revolution lies in its introduction of methodologies borrowed from the 
social sciences, such as statistical analysis and survey research, which allowed for more systematic and 
quantifiable study of political phenomena. This methodological shift enabled the development of theories 
based on observed data, rather than purely on philosophical or theoretical speculation. For example, the use 
of polling and behavioral surveys illuminated the complexities of voter behavior, showing that it was not just 
ideological affiliations but also socio-economic factors, personality, media influence, and cognitive biases that 
could influence voting patterns. 
 
One of the major contributions of this approach was its emphasis on the irrational aspects of political 
behavior, challenging the assumption that individuals always act rationally in the political sphere. This was 
further explored in works like "The American Voter" (1960) by Angus Campbell, Philip Converse, Warren 
Miller, and Donald Stokes, which analyzed voter decision-making processes and introduced the concept of 
party identification as a deep psychological orientation.

Furthermore, the Behavioral Revolution led to a broader understanding of political culture as articulated by 
Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba in "The Civic Culture" (1963). Their comparative study of five nations 
offered insights into how and why different societies developed distinct political behaviors and how these 
behaviors influenced the stability and functioning of democratic systems. 
Critically, while the Behavioral Revolution enhanced the analytical precision in political science, it also 
attracted criticism for possibly de-emphasizing the importance of political institutions and the broader socio-
economic and historical contexts. Critics like Giovanni Sartori argued that the focus on individual behavior 
might overlook the structural and institutional factors that are equally crucial in shaping political outcomes. 
 
The Behavioral Revolution significantly transformed the landscape of political science by embedding rigorous 
empirical methods and a focus on individual political behavior into the study of politics. This shift not only 
expanded the boundaries of the field but also deepened our understanding of the complexities of political 
actions and interactions in modern democracies, thus enabling a more nuanced examination of how 
democracies function and how political decisions are made at the individual level. 
 

Q.2) Difference between normative and empirical theories of politics. (2012) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Highlight the foundational difference between normative and empirical theories in political science, 

emphasizing their divergent approaches to studying political phenomena. 
Body:  
• Discuss key examples of normative and empirical theories, such as John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" 

and Robert Putnam's "Making Democracy Work," illustrating their distinct methodologies and 
objectives. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the complementary nature of normative and empirical theories, noting how they contribute 

to a comprehensive understanding of political systems by addressing both ethical ideals and observable 
realities. 

 
The difference between normative and empirical theories of politics is foundational to the discipline of political 
science, reflecting distinct approaches and objectives in the study of political phenomena. Normative theories 
are primarily concerned with questions of what should be and focus on the ethical, moral, and philosophical 
dimensions of political life. They explore ideals, values, and principles that should govern political institutions 
and behaviors. In contrast, empirical theories aim to observe, describe, and explain political behavior as it 
actually occurs, employing scientific methods to gather data and test hypotheses about the functioning of 
political systems. 
 
Normative political theory includes thinkers like John Rawls, who in his work "A Theory of Justice" (1971), 
presented principles of justice and fairness in the distribution of wealth and opportunities within a society. 
Rawls’ ideas are fundamentally normative because they seek to establish an ideal standard based on ethical 
reasoning about how society ought to be structured. He famously stated, “Justice is the first virtue of social 
institutions, as truth is of systems of thought.” This emphasizes a conceptual framework centered on ethical 
judgments and moral prescriptions rather than empirical verification.

On the other hand, empirical political theories rely on observable data to make claims about political behavior. 
Scholars like Robert Putnam, in his influential work "Making Democracy Work" (1993), utilized vast amounts 
of data to argue that civic communities in northern Italy were more successful democratically due to higher 
levels of civic engagement and social capital. Putnam’s approach is empirical as it builds its conclusions on 
observed behaviors and statistical analysis, presenting a model that can be tested and falsified through further 
observation and experimentation. 
 
The methodological differences between these two approaches are significant. Normative theory often 
involves philosophical argumentation and does not necessarily require empirical evidence to support its 
claims, as it deals with values and ideals. In contrast, empirical theory is characterized by the scientific method, 
involving hypothesis formulation, systematic observation, and statistical analysis to validate or refute claims. 
 
Both approaches, however, contribute indispensably to the field of political science. While empirical theories 
provide a systematic understanding of political behaviors and structures, normative theories guide discussions 
on how political systems ought to function and the ethical bases of political authority and rights. For example, 
debates around democratic governance involve empirical analysis of voting patterns and government 
efficiency, as well as normative discussions about voter rights and the ethical obligations of elected officials. 
 
In summary, the primary distinction between normative and empirical theories in politics lies in their 
respective focuses on 'ought' versus 'is'—the ethical ideals versus measurable realities of political life. This 
dichotomy enriches the study of political science, ensuring a balanced examination that addresses both the 
theoretical ideals and the practical realities of political systems. 
 

Q.3) Comment on Systems Approach (10 marks) (2022) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the systems approach in political science, emphasizing its conceptualization of entities as 

interconnected systems pioneered by scholars like Ludwig von Bertalanffy. 
Body:  
• Discuss the application of the systems approach in political science, citing David Easton's work and its 

influence on understanding political systems as dynamic entities interacting with their environments. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance of the systems approach in political science, highlighting its value in 

analyzing complexity, change, and interdependence within political systems, ultimately providing a 
holistic perspective on political phenomena. 

 
The systems approach in political science and other disciplines conceptualizes entities (whether organisms, 
ecosystems, social organizations, or political entities) as systems with interconnected and interdependent 
components. This perspective, pioneered by scholars like Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the mid-20th century, 
emphasizes that systems cannot be fully understood by analyzing their parts in isolation; rather, the focus is 
on how parts interact within the whole system. In the context of political science, David Easton's "A Systems 
Analysis of Political Life" stands as a seminal work that applied the systems approach to understand political

systems. Easton depicted the political system as a set of interactions within a social system, processing inputs 
(demands and supports) into outputs (policies and decisions) that feedback into the system, influencing future 
inputs. 
 
The systems approach has been influential in various fields, exemplified in the work of Niklas Luhmann, who 
expanded the concept within sociology by introducing the theory of social systems, which analyzes society as 
a complex system of communications. In political science, it has encouraged the examination of political 
entities as dynamic and open systems that interact with and adapt to their environments. This approach has 
been instrumental in the study of international relations, governance, and policy analysis, offering insights 
into the complexity of political processes and the interplay between political institutions and societal forces. 
 
The systems approach underlines the importance of understanding political phenomena in a holistic manner, 
taking into account the multifaceted interactions and feedback loops between the political system and its 
external environment. By doing so, it provides a valuable framework for analyzing stability, change, and 
complexity in political systems, offering a comprehensive perspective on how political entities operate and 
evolve over time. 
 

Q.4) Discuss David Easton’s model of systems analysis. (2015) (15) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce David Easton's systems analysis model as a pioneering approach in political science, 

emphasizing its focus on understanding political systems as dynamic entities interacting with their 
environment. 

Body:  
• Discuss Easton's model, highlighting its core components such as inputs, outputs, feedback loops, and 

system adaptation, along with its application across different political contexts. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance of Easton's model in providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing 

political systems, despite criticisms, and its enduring impact on the field of political science. 
 
David Easton's model of systems analysis, introduced in his seminal works "The Political System" (1953) and 
"A Framework for Political Analysis" (1965), represents a pioneering approach to understanding political 
phenomena. As a political scientist, Easton developed the systems analysis model to offer a comprehensive 
and coherent framework for analyzing political systems and their functions. His model is grounded in the 
general systems theory, which views political systems as open systems interacting with their environment. 
 
Easton defines a political system as a set of interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for 
a society. The core of Easton's systems analysis model lies in its focus on the flow of inputs and outputs 
between the political system and its environment. Inputs come in the form of demands and supports from 
individuals and groups within society, such as public opinion, interest group pressures, and political actions. 
These inputs are processed by the political system, leading to outputs in the form of policies, decisions, and 
regulations that aim to address or respond to the demands.

A crucial aspect of Easton's model is the feedback loop, where outputs from the system enter back into the 
social environment and influence subsequent inputs. This feedback mechanism allows the political system to 
adjust and adapt to changes in its environment, ensuring stability and continuity. Easton emphasizes the 
adaptive capacity of political systems, highlighting the importance of responsiveness to environmental 
changes in maintaining system persistence and avoiding breakdown. 
 
Easton's model also introduces the concepts of "stress" and "disturbances" to the political system, which can 
arise from internal or external sources and challenge the system's stability. The system's response to such 
stresses, through processes of regulation, adaptation, and policy-making, is critical for its survival. According 
to Easton, a political system's effectiveness can be measured by its ability to manage and absorb these stresses 
without undergoing fundamental changes to its structure or function. 
 
One of the key contributions of Easton's systems analysis model is its abstract and generalized approach, 
allowing for the examination of political systems across different contexts and levels, from local governments 
to international relations. This universality has made it a valuable tool for comparative politics and policy 
analysis. 
 
However, Easton's model has faced criticism for its perceived emphasis on system stability and equilibrium, 
potentially underplaying the dynamics of change and conflict within political systems. Critics argue that the 
model may overlook the significance of power relations and ideological struggles in shaping political outcomes. 
 
In conclusion, David Easton's systems analysis model offers a foundational framework for understanding the 
complexities of political systems. By conceptualizing political systems as open systems engaged in continuous 
exchanges with their environment, Easton provides insights into the processes of policy-making, adaptation, 
and system persistence. Despite critiques, his model remains a cornerstone of political science, contributing 
significantly to the theoretical and methodological development of the discipline. 
 

Q.5) Discuss the significance of normative approach to political theory. (15 marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the normative approach to political theory as pivotal in shaping ethical foundations, 

contrasting it with descriptive approaches. 
Body:  
• Discuss key scholars like Rawls and Nozick, outlining their distinct visions of justice and illustrating the 

breadth of the normative approach. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance of the normative approach in guiding political discourse, policy-making, and 

societal development towards ethical objectives, fostering reflection and dialogue on principles that 
shape political life. 

 
The normative approach to political theory is instrumental in understanding and shaping the ethical 
foundations of political systems and institutions. This approach, distinguished by its focus on what ought to 
be rather than what is, delves into the ethical, moral, and justice-oriented dimensions of political life.

Scholars such as John Rawls and Robert Nozick have been pivotal in advancing this approach, each proposing 
distinct visions of a just society that illustrate its breadth and diversity. For instance, Rawls' theory of justice 
as fairness, articulated in his seminal work "A Theory of Justice," advocates for principles of justice designed 
to ensure a fair distribution of resources and opportunities, emphasizing the veil of ignorance as a method for 
achieving impartiality. Conversely, Nozick's libertarian perspective, detailed in "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," 
champions minimal state intervention and prioritizes individual rights and freedoms, illustrating a 
fundamentally different normative vision. 
The significance of the normative approach lies in its capacity to guide political discourse, policy-making, and 
the development of legal systems towards ethical objectives. It provides a critical framework for evaluating 
the legitimacy of political authority, the rights of individuals and communities, and the justice of social 
arrangements. By engaging with questions of what should constitute the common good, the role of 
government in promoting social justice, and the rights and duties of citizens, the normative approach fosters 
a more reflective and principled engagement with political issues.  
 
Moreover, it challenges practitioners and theorists alike to envision and work towards more just and equitable 
societies. In doing so, the normative approach not only enriches political theory but also influences the 
practical realm of politics, informing debates on contemporary issues such as inequality, human rights, and 
democracy. Through its focus on ethical principles and values, the normative approach remains a vital 
component of political theory, encouraging ongoing dialogue and reflection on the ideals that shape political 
life. 
 

Q.6) Comment on Difference between normative and empirical theories of politics. (2012) (10 marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the subject by highlighting the distinction between normative and empirical theories of 

politics, emphasizing their foundational differences in focus and methodology. 
Body:  
• Briefly explain normative theories by citing the work of John Rawls as an example of how they prescribe 

ideal political structures based on ethical principles. Contrast this with a description of empirical 
theories, using Robert Dahl's research to illustrate how they rely on data to explain political realities. 

Conclusion:  
• Sum up by reiterating the main difference in objectives and methods between the two theories, and 

mention their complementary roles in enhancing the understanding of political science. 
 
Normative and empirical theories of politics represent two distinct approaches within the study of political 
science, each with its unique focus and methodology.  
 
Normative theories are concerned with prescribing how things should be, based on ethical, moral, or 
philosophical principles. They delve into questions of justice, rights, and the ideal organization of society, 
offering frameworks for evaluating political systems and behaviors. Notable scholars like John Rawls, in his 
work "A Theory of Justice," exemplify this approach by proposing principles of justice to guide the structure

of a fair and equitable society. Rawls's theory, with its emphasis on the veil of ignorance and the difference 
principle, provides a normative framework for assessing and establishing political institutions and practices. 
 
In contrast, empirical theories of politics are centered on describing and explaining political phenomena as 
they are, rather than how they ought to be. This approach relies on observation, data collection, and statistical 
analysis to understand political behaviors, systems, and processes. Empirical theories seek to establish causal 
relationships and generalizable patterns within the political realm. Scholars like Robert Dahl have contributed 
significantly to empirical political science, especially with works such as "Who Governs?" which analyzes power 
structures in New Haven, Connecticut, to discuss broader themes of democracy and pluralism. Dahl's research 
exemplifies how empirical theories aim to ground political science in observable facts and trends, providing a 
descriptive and analytical basis for understanding how political systems operate in reality. 
 
The primary difference between normative and empirical theories of politics lies in their objectives and 
methods. While normative theories engage with ideals and ethical considerations to suggest how politics 
should function, empirical theories focus on observable phenomena to explain how politics actually functions. 
This distinction underscores the complementary nature of these approaches, as normative theories provide 
the goals and values against which political realities, explored through empirical theories, can be evaluated 
and understood. 
 

Q.7) Normative approach in Political Science. (10 Marks) (2023) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the normative approach in political science, focusing on its ethical, moral, and value-based 

analysis and prescriptions for political systems. 
Body: 
• Discuss the contributions of John Rawls to normative political theory, particularly his "justice as 

fairness" principles, and contrast these ideas with criticisms from realist theorists and other figures like 
Michael Sandel and Amartya Sen. 

Conclusion: 
• Summarize the significance of the normative approach in shaping ethical political discussions and its 

ongoing evolution in addressing new societal challenges. 
 
The normative approach in political science refers to the analysis, interpretation, and prescription of how 
political and societal systems ought to operate, focusing on ethical, moral, and value-based considerations. 
This approach contrasts with the empirical approach, which seeks to observe and explain political phenomena 
without making judgments about their desirability. Normative political theory delves into questions of justice, 
rights, democracy, and the good life, aiming to establish criteria for evaluating political institutions and 
practices. 
 
One of the central figures in contemporary normative political theory is John Rawls, whose work "A Theory of 
Justice" (1971) has had a profound impact on how justice is conceptualized within political philosophy. Rawls 
introduces the principles of "justice as fairness," utilizing the original position and the veil of ignorance as 
thought experiments to derive principles of justice that rational and self-interested individuals would choose

in a hypothetical state of equality. Rawls's two principles of justice — the first ensuring equal basic liberties 
for all, and the second arranging social and economic inequalities so that they are to the greatest benefit of 
the least advantaged — provide a normative framework for assessing the fairness of social institutions. 
 
Critics of the normative approach argue that its focus on how things ought to be may overlook how they 
actually are, potentially rendering its prescriptions unrealistic or inapplicable. Realist theorists, for example, 
criticize normative theorists for neglecting the inherent power struggles and conflicts of interest that 
characterize political life. However, proponents of the normative approach contend that understanding the 
ethical and moral foundations of political life is crucial for guiding political action and reform. They argue that 
empirical analysis alone cannot address the fundamental questions of value and purpose that underpin 
political systems. 
 
Another influential figure in normative political theory is Michael Sandel, who, in works like "Justice: What's 
the Right Thing to Do?" (2009), challenges the liberal individualism of Rawls's theory. Sandel emphasizes the 
role of community and the moral engagements that bind individuals together, advocating for a political 
philosophy that acknowledges the embeddedness of individuals in social and moral contexts. This highlights a 
key debate within normative political theory: the tension between individual rights and the common good. 
 
Normative political theory also intersects with discussions about democracy, equality, and human rights. 
Authors like Amartya Sen, in "The Idea of Justice" (2009), broaden the framework for understanding justice, 
incorporating elements of welfare economics and capabilities to address global injustices. Sen's approach 
underscores the importance of public reasoning and the practical realization of justice, contributing to the 
normative discourse with a focus on outcomes as well as principles. 
 
In summary, the normative approach in political science plays a crucial role in exploring the ethical dimensions 
of political life, offering visions of what a just, fair, and desirable political order might look like. Despite 
criticisms regarding its practical applicability, the normative approach enriches political discourse by 
challenging us to reflect on the values and principles that should guide political institutions and practices. 
Through the work of theorists like Rawls, Sandel, and Sen, normative political theory continues to evolve, 
addressing new challenges and incorporating diverse perspectives in the quest for a more just and equitable 
society.

• Summarize the impact of this resurgence on the intellectual landscape, noting how political theory 
offers essential frameworks for addressing contemporary global challenges. 

 
The resurgence of political theory in the latter half of the 20th century marked a profound revitalization of 
debates concerning justice, democracy, and human rights, responding to the limitations of positivist 
approaches that dominated the social sciences. This renaissance was catalyzed by the emergence of new social 
movements demanding civil rights, gender equality, and environmental protection, alongside a scholarly 
critique of the narrow empirical focus that had previously sidelined normative questions. 
 
Key figures like John Rawls played a pivotal role in this resurgence, with Rawls' "A Theory of Justice" (1971) 
reigniting discussions on distributive justice and the principles underlying a fair society. This period also saw 
an expansion of political theory into new domains, incorporating insights from feminism, as seen in the works 
of Carol Gilligan and Nancy Fraser, post-colonialism, influenced by Edward Said and Homi Bhabha, and 
environmentalism, through thinkers like Vandana Shiva. These scholars extended political theory beyond 
traditional boundaries, engaging with questions of identity, difference, and the human relationship with 
nature. 
 
The resurgence of political theory has significantly enriched the intellectual landscape, offering nuanced 
frameworks for understanding and addressing the complexities of contemporary political life. By challenging 
reductionist views and embracing the plurality of human experience, political theory has become an 
indispensable tool in navigating the challenges of the modern world, from global inequality to the crisis of 
democracy and the threat of ecological collapse. 
 

Q.9) Comment on: Decline of Political Theory (10) (2018) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the debate on the "decline of political theory," linking it to the rise of empirical methodologies 

that prioritize quantifiable research over philosophical inquiry. 
Body: 
• Discuss the perspectives of Leo Strauss and Sheldon Wolin on the shift away from classical political 

philosophy's depth, and mention the contributions of contemporary scholars like Martha Nussbaum 
and Amartya Sen in bridging empirical research with normative theorizing. 

Conclusion: 
• Summarize the ongoing vitality and relevance of political theory, emphasizing the opportunity for 

integrating empirical and normative approaches to enrich political science.  
 
The discourse on the "decline of political theory" reflects concerns about the evolving nature and perceived 
diminishing significance of political theory within the broader field of political science. This debate is intricately 
linked to the rise of empirical methodologies and the prioritization of quantifiable research over qualitative, 
philosophical inquiry. Scholars such as Leo Strauss and Sheldon Wolin have been vocal critics of this trend, 
arguing that the shift towards empirical analysis and the relegation of normative questions have led to a 
diminution in the depth and richness of political discourse.

Strauss, in particular, lamented the loss of classical political philosophy's insights into the nature of the good 
life and the ethical foundations of political community. His work often highlighted the importance of returning 
to the Socratic tradition of questioning and the examination of fundamental principles, as opposed to merely 
describing political behaviors or institutions. Sheldon Wolin, through his seminal text "Politics and Vision," 
similarly critiqued the modern political science field for its detachment from the transformative and visionary 
aspects of political theorizing, suggesting that this trend undermines the capacity of political theory to address 
the existential and moral questions that underlie political life. 
 
The "decline of political theory" debate also touches upon the fragmentation within the discipline, where 
specialized subfields and the emphasis on methodological rigor may overshadow comprehensive, 
philosophically oriented inquiries into political phenomena. This has led to concerns about the relevance and 
impact of political theory on contemporary political challenges, including issues of justice, democracy, and 
power. 
 
However, it's important to note that the debate itself has sparked a reinvigoration of interest in normative 
and philosophical dimensions of politics. Contemporary scholars like Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen have 
successfully bridged empirical research with normative theorizing, particularly in areas like capabilities 
approach to development and justice. Their work demonstrates that political theory remains vital in providing 
ethical direction and critical frameworks for understanding and addressing the complexities of political life. 
 
while there are concerns about the "decline of political theory," the ongoing dialogue among scholars reflects 
a vibrant, if contested, space for debate and innovation. The challenge and opportunity lie in integrating the 
empirical strengths of political science with the normative and philosophical rigor of political theory, ensuring 
that the discipline remains both analytically robust and ethically engaged. 
 

Q.10) Comment on: The Post-Behavioural Approach. (10) (2016) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the Post-Behavioural Approach as a response to behaviouralism, highlighting its emphasis on 

reintroducing normative concerns and relevance to societal issues. 
Body: 
• Discuss David Easton's advocacy for a balanced approach between empirical rigor and ethical 

engagement, and explore how this philosophy has influenced developments in areas like feminist 
political analysis and new institutionalism. 

Conclusion: 
• Summarize the impact of the Post-Behavioural Approach on political science, emphasizing its role in 

making the discipline more ethically aware and responsive to societal needs. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach in political science emerged as a response to the perceived limitations of the 
behaviouralism movement, which emphasized empirical, statistical, and often quantitative methods in the 
study of political phenomena. Post-behaviouralism, crystallizing in the late 1960s and early 1970s, sought to 
reintroduce normative concerns, ethical judgments, and a focus on addressing real-world problems into 
political science. This shift was partly a reaction to societal upheavals, including civil rights movements and

anti-war protests, which highlighted the need for political science to be more directly relevant to societal 
issues and ethical considerations. 
 
David Easton, a key figure in this transition, articulated the need for a “post-behavioural revolution” in his 
1969 presidential address to the American Political Science Association. He advocated for a balance between 
rigorous scientific methods and the pursuit of relevance to public policy and moral concerns. Easton’s call for 
a science that is both empirically sound and directly engaged with the values and issues of society reflects the 
core of the post-behavioural critique. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach emphasizes the importance of values in political research, arguing that science 
cannot be value-free, especially when it comes to studying human behavior and societal structures. It 
encourages scholars to not only describe and analyze political phenomena but also to engage with questions 
of what ought to be, combining empirical research with normative theory. This approach has fostered a more 
holistic understanding of political phenomena, integrating insights from various disciplines and perspectives. 
 
The influence of post-behaviouralism can be seen in the subsequent development of critical theories, feminist 
political analysis, and the new institutionalism, all of which underscore the importance of considering values, 
power dynamics, and the broader societal context in political science research. By advocating for a science 
that is more attuned to the complexities of political life and the ethical dimensions of political action, the Post-
Behavioural Approach has enriched the field, making it more responsive to the challenges and needs of 
society. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach represents a significant shift in political science, highlighting the discipline's 
engagement with ethical concerns and real-world relevance. It serves as a reminder of the importance of 
balancing methodological rigor with the pursuit of knowledge that is meaningful and beneficial to society.
