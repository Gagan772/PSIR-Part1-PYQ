## Q3. Difference Principle in Rawls Theory of Justice (2015, 10 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The Difference Principle, part of Rawls's second principle of justice, permits social and economic inequalities only if they maximally benefit the least advantaged members of society and are attached to positions open under fair equality of opportunity—reconciling efficiency with equity by justifying inequalities that improve everyone's position, especially those at the bottom.

## Q4. Entitlement Theory of Justice (2022, 15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Robert Nozick's entitlement theory of justice presents a libertarian framework based on three principles—just acquisition (legitimate means), just transfer (voluntary exchange), and rectification (correcting past injustice)—advocating for a minimal "night-watchman" state that protects property rights without redistributive intervention, challenging Rawlsian welfare-state liberalism.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Entitlement Theory` | `Robert Nozick` | `Libertarianism` | `Justice in Acquisition` | `Justice in Transfer` | `Rectification` | `Minimal State` | `Property Rights` | `Anarchy State and Utopia` | `Historical Principles`

- Anti-redistributive stance

**Body:**

*Principle 1 - Just Acquisition:*
- Individuals entitled to acquire property
- Through legitimate means
- **Methods**: Voluntary exchanges, own labor, gifts
- Must not infringe others' rights
- **Influenced by John Locke**: Natural right to property through labor

- Buying and selling car
- Recognizes just transfer of property rights
- Market outcomes legitimate if process fair
- No end-state pattern required

*Principle 3 - Rectification:*
- Addresses historical injustices
- Rights violations in past
- **Nozick on rectification**: "If past injustice rectified by transfer of holdings"
- "Holdings transferred must be of persons wronged"
- Not all acquisitions/transfers historically just
- Some resulted from force or fraud
- Rectification corrects specific past wrongs
- Does not endorse general redistribution
- Commitment to individual rights
- Property acquired justly is entitled
- Limited backward-looking correction

*Minimal State Concept:*
- Entails idea of minimal state
- "Night-watchman" state metaphor
- Limited role in society
- **Nozick's vision**: "Minimal state limited to narrow functions"

- "Enforcement of contracts, and so on"
- "Is inspiring as well as right"
- Primary duty: Safeguard rights
- Life, liberty, property protection
- No extensive regulatory activities
- No redistributive programs
- Avoid infringing on entitlements

*Anti-Redistributive Argument:*
- Taxation for redistribution is forced labor
- Takes fruits of one's labor
- Violates self-ownership
- Each person owns themselves
- State has no right to redistribute
- Even for worthy social goals
- Liberty trumps equality
- Process matters over outcomes

**Conclusion:**
- Provides clear and coherent framework
- Understanding justice through entitlement
- Subject of extensive debate
- Critics: May result in extreme inequalities
- Insufficiently addresses systemic issues
- Wealth distribution problems
- Social justice concerns
- Nonetheless continues to influence

### 👨‍🎓 Scholars to Quote

| Scholar | Key Idea/Quote |
|:--------|:---------------|
| **Robert Nozick** | "Individuals have rights, and there are things no person or group may do to them (without violating their rights)" - foundation of entitlement theory |
| **Nozick (Just Transfer)** | "Whatever arises from a just situation by just steps is itself just" - voluntary exchanges produce just outcomes |
| **Nozick (Minimal State)** | "Minimal state limited to narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts...is inspiring as well as right" |
| **John Locke** | Influenced Nozick: natural right to acquire property through one's labor; labor theory of acquisition |
| **Nozick (Rectification)** | "If past injustice is rectified...holdings transferred must be holdings of persons who were wronged" - corrects specific wrongs, not general redistribution |

### 💡 Examples Checklist

✓ **Just Acquisition**: Homesteading unclaimed land, creating artwork, voluntary gift  
✓ **Just Transfer**: Free market transactions, voluntary charity, inheritance  
✓ **Minimal State**: Police, courts, national defense only  
✓ **Violation of Entitlement**: Taxation for welfare (seen as forced labor)  
✓ **Rectification**: Returning stolen property, compensation for slavery's descendants (debated)  
✓ **Voluntary Exchange**: Chamberlain example - fans voluntarily pay, creating wealth inequality justly

```

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Nozick's entitlement theory makes a radical claim: justice lies not in how wealth is distributed but in how it was acquired—if earned justly and transferred voluntarily, inequality is not injustice but liberty; to tax the rich for the poor is, Nozick whispers provocatively, to make some people slaves to others' needs; the minimal state protects rights, it doesn't redistribute them."*

*"Communitarians remind liberals of a truth forgotten in modernity's rush to individual rights: we are not atoms but members, not strangers but neighbors; justice cannot float free of culture, tradition, and shared purpose; MacIntyre, Sandel, and Taylor teach that before asking 'what's mine?' we must ask 'who are we?'—for identity precedes rights, community shapes self, and the good life is lived together, not alone."*

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Rawls's genius lies in wedding procedure to substance, contract to distribution—the original position doesn't just generate abstract principles but concrete distributive rules; behind the veil, rational self-interest produces moral fairness; thus Rawls proves that liberty and equality, often seen as opposites, are actually partners: free people choosing fairly choose a society that's both free and fair."*

## Q12. Comparative Assessment: Greek vs Rawlsian Justice (2020, 20 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Greek justice (Plato's harmony of classes, Aristotle's proportional equality based on merit) emphasizes virtue, natural order, and the common good through teleological frameworks—contrasting with Rawlsian justice as fairness derived contractually from original position, prioritizing individual rights, fair opportunity, and benefiting the least advantaged, revealing convergence on justice's centrality but divergence in methodology (teleological vs contractual), focus (community vs individual), and foundations (natural order vs rational choice).

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Plato` | `Aristotle` | `Greek Justice` | `Distributive Justice` | `Corrective Justice` | `Teleological` | `Merit-Based` | `Common Good` | `Rawlsian Justice` | `Contractual vs Virtue`

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Greek and Rawlsian justice represent philosophy's eternal dialogue—the ancients ask 'what is your virtue, your place, your contribution to the whole?', Rawls asks 'what would you choose not knowing your position?'; Plato seeks harmony in hierarchy, Aristotle justice in merit, Rawls fairness in procedure; one finds justice in nature's order, the other in reason's choice; yet both traditions teach that justice is not luxury but necessity, not preference but foundation—societies without justice, whether ancient polis or modern democracy, ultimately crumble."*

- ❌ "Rawls's theory is perfect" (for "examine" questions)
- ✅ "While Rawls offers systematic framework, Sandel critiques..." (present + critique)

**4. Ignoring Question Demand:**
- "Examine" ≠ "Critically examine" ≠ "Discuss" ≠ "Comment on"
- "Examine": Explain thoroughly with analysis
- "Critically examine": Explain + Strengths + Weaknesses + Evaluation
- "Comment on": Brief explanation with significance and debates

- ✅ Theory + Contemporary relevance + Policy implications + Examples

**6. Conclusion Neglect:**
- NEVER skip conclusion—it's 10-15% of marks
- Weak: "Thus Rawls's theory is important."
- Strong: "Rawls transforms justice from philosophical abstraction to rational choice—behind the veil..."
