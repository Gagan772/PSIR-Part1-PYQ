Q.1) Comment on Original position (2013) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Rawls's concept of the Original Position as a central feature of his theory of justice, 

designed to determine fair principles of societal governance through a unique thought experiment. 
Body:  
• Explain the mechanics of the Original Position, including the "veil of ignorance" and the two resulting 

principles of justice—the liberty principle and the difference principle. Discuss the purpose and 
intended outcomes of this framework for establishing a just society. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the significance and impact of the Original Position on political philosophy, noting ongoing 

debates and its role in shaping contemporary discussions on justice and equality.  
 
The concept of the Original Position is a fundamental element of John Rawls's theory of justice, as articulated 
in his seminal work "A Theory of Justice" (1971). This hypothetical scenario serves as a thought experiment 
designed to establish a fair procedure for agreeing on the principles of justice that should govern the basic 
structure of society. In the Original Position, individuals are placed behind a "veil of ignorance," which obscures 
all knowledge of their personal characteristics, such as race, gender, intelligence, abilities, and social status. 
This ensures that principles chosen are not biased by personal interests and are, therefore, just and impartial. 
 
Rawls argues that under these conditions, rational individuals would unanimously adopt two principles of 
justice: the first principle guarantees the maximum equal basic liberties for all, and the second, the difference 
principle, stipulates that social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) to the 
greatest benefit of the least advantaged and (b) attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions 
of fair equality of opportunity. This framework aims to secure a fair and equitable society where individual 
freedoms are respected, and inequalities are only permitted if they benefit the least advantaged members of 
society. 
 
The Original Position is significant because it provides a methodological foundation for Rawls's theory of 
justice, emphasizing fairness as the key to determining the moral principles that should underpin political and 
social institutions. By hypothetically removing the knowledge of one's circumstances, Rawls intends to achieve 
impartiality in the selection of principles of justice, fostering outcomes that are unbiased and universally 
acceptable. 
 
Scholars and philosophers have extensively debated and critiqued Rawls's Original Position, considering its 
practical applicability and theoretical soundness. Despite criticisms, the Original Position remains a pivotal 
contribution to political philosophy, influencing contemporary discussions on justice, equality, and the moral 
foundations of democratic societies. It represents Rawls's attempt to address the question of how individuals, 
considered as free and equal, would structure a just society if given the opportunity to do so under fair 
conditions.

Q.2) Comment on Distributive Justice. (2018) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce distributive justice as a key area of study in political science, emphasizing its role in assessing 

the fairness of resource allocation in society. 
Body:  
• Describe influential theories including Rawls's justice as fairness, Nozick's entitlement theory, and the 

capabilities approach by Nussbaum and Sen, highlighting their different views on what constitutes a fair 
distribution of resources. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the ongoing debate on distributive justice, noting its significance in shaping ethical public 

policy and the pursuit of equitable societies.  
 
Distributive justice is a central concern in political science, focusing on the fair allocation of resources and 
wealth among individuals in a society. This concept addresses questions of fairness, equality, and equity in the 
distribution of goods, services, and opportunities. Theories of distributive justice vary widely, reflecting 
differing beliefs about what constitutes a fair distribution, the role of the state in redistributing resources, and 
the balance between individual rights and collective welfare. 
 
One of the most influential theories of distributive justice is John Rawls's theory of justice as fairness, 
presented in his landmark work "A Theory of Justice." Rawls proposes two principles of justice: the first 
principle asserts that each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with 
a similar liberty for others; the second principle, known as the difference principle, states that social and 
economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged 
and attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. Rawls's 
approach emphasizes a system of distribution that compensates for social and natural contingencies that 
arbitrarily affect individuals' life chances. 
 
Another significant perspective comes from Robert Nozick, who, in his work "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," 
challenges Rawlsian redistributive policies. Nozick advocates for a minimal state and argues for a concept of 
distributive justice based on historical entitlement rather than patterns or end-states. According to Nozick, 
justice in distribution depends on how holdings are acquired (justice in acquisition), transferred (justice in 
transfer), and rectified in case of unjust acquisition. Nozick's entitlement theory thus places a strong emphasis 
on individual property rights and voluntary transactions as the basis of justice. 
 
Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen have also contributed significantly to the discussion of distributive justice 
through the capabilities approach. This perspective focuses on what individuals are able to do and to be — in 
other words, their capabilities to lead the kind of lives they value. Rather than merely assessing the distribution 
of resources, the capabilities approach evaluates the actual freedoms and opportunities available to 
individuals, arguing for a distribution that enables all individuals to achieve a set of basic capabilities. 
 
The debate on distributive justice is broad and diverse, reflecting a range of philosophical foundations and 
implications for public policy. Whether through Rawls's principles of justice, Nozick's entitlement theory, or

the capabilities approach of Nussbaum and Sen, discussions of distributive justice explore the ethical 
dimensions of how societies distribute resources — a question that remains central to political philosophy and 
to the design of equitable and just societies. 
 

Q.3) Comment on Difference Principle in Rawls Theory of Justice. (2015) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the Difference Principle as a fundamental aspect of John Rawls's theory of justice, designed 

to ensure that social and economic inequalities benefit the least advantaged. 
Body:  
• Explain how the Difference Principle functions within Rawls's framework, detailing its relationship with 

the principle of equal opportunity and its justification through the Original Position and Veil of 
Ignorance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the impact and the ongoing debates surrounding the Difference Principle, highlighting its 

role in contemporary discussions on justice and equity. 
 
The Difference Principle is a crucial component of John Rawls's theory of justice, as articulated in his seminal 
work, "A Theory of Justice." This principle is part of Rawls's broader conceptual framework aimed at 
establishing a just and equitable society.  
 
According to Rawls, a fair distribution of resources is essential for justice, and the Difference Principle plays a 
key role in achieving this fairness. It stipulates that inequalities in social and economic goods are permissible 
only if they result in compensatory benefits for the least advantaged members of society. Essentially, Rawls 
argues that a just society should not necessarily seek to eliminate inequalities but should ensure that any 
inequalities work to the advantage of those who are least well-off. 
 
The Difference Principle is the second part of Rawls's second principle of justice. The first part of this principle 
demands equality of opportunity, meaning that everyone should have the same chances to access positions 
of advantage. The Difference Principle builds on this by specifying that any resulting economic inequalities 
must meet the condition of being to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged groups. This concept reflects 
Rawls's attempt to reconcile the values of freedom and equality by showing that a just society can 
accommodate inequalities, provided they are structured in a way that they could be justified to everyone, 
especially those who receive the smallest share of society's wealth. 
 
Rawls employs the Original Position and the Veil of Ignorance as methodological tools to derive the Difference 
Principle. Individuals in the Original Position, lacking any knowledge of their own place in society, would 
choose principles of justice (including the Difference Principle) to ensure fair treatment regardless of their 
eventual status in society. This thought experiment supports the idea that rational individuals, seeking to 
protect their own interests without knowing their future position, would agree to a system that benefits 
everyone, especially the least advantaged.

The Difference Principle has sparked considerable debate and critique. Some argue that it allows for too much 
inequality, while others contend it demands too much redistribution. Despite these debates, the Difference 
Principle remains a landmark proposal in political philosophy, challenging how we think about justice and 
equality. It invites ongoing discussion about how best to structure societies in ways that balance efficiency, 
liberty, and fairness, illustrating Rawls's profound impact on contemporary ethical and political thought. 
 

Q.4) Examine the entitlement theory of justice. (15 Marks) (2022) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce Robert Nozick's entitlement theory of justice from "Anarchy, State, and Utopia," emphasizing 

its libertarian approach and foundation on individual rights. 
Body:  
• Explain Nozick's three principles: acquisition, transfer, and rectification, detailing how each contributes 

to a just society under his theory, and discuss the minimal role of the state as envisioned by Nozick. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize the impact and critiques of the entitlement theory, noting its ongoing relevance and debate 

in discussions of justice and political philosophy.  
 
The entitlement theory of justice, as expounded by the American philosopher Robert Nozick in his influential 
work "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" (1974), offers a unique and libertarian perspective on justice. This theory 
is constructed upon three foundational principles. As Nozick states, "Individuals have rights, and there are 
things no person or group may do to them (without violating their rights)."  
 
First, the principle of acquisition maintains that individuals are entitled to acquire property through legitimate 
means, such as voluntary exchanges, their own labor, or gifts, as long as these actions do not infringe upon 
the rights of others. Scholars like Robert Nozick himself and John Locke, whose ideas influenced Nozick, 
support the idea that individuals have a natural right to acquire property through their labor. 
 
Second, the principle of transfer, which Nozick terms "the principle of justice in transfer," underscores the 
legitimacy of voluntary property transfers among individuals. This principle, as Nozick elaborates, is rooted in 
individual autonomy: "Whatever arises from a just situation by just steps is itself just." In essence, if individuals 
willingly exchange or transfer their property without coercion or fraud, the resulting distribution is considered 
just. For instance, when two individuals voluntarily engage in a fair-market transaction, such as buying and 
selling a car, the entitlement theory recognizes this as a just transfer of property rights. 
 
Nozick's theory also introduces the principle of rectification, which addresses historical injustices and rights 
violations. Nozick argues that "if past injustice is rectified by something like a transfer of holdings now, the 
holdings transferred must be holdings, taken by and large, of the persons who, ex hypothesi, were 
wronged." This principle acknowledges that not all property acquisitions and transfers have been just 
throughout history, and some may have resulted from force or fraud. Rectification, however, aims to correct 
these specific past wrongs without endorsing general wealth redistribution. This concept reflects Nozick's 

Click here to Join / Civils Front Click here to Join / PSIR – Civils Front

commitment to individual rights and the principle that individuals are entitled to the property they have 
acquired justly. 
 
Nozick's entitlement theory of justice also entails the idea of a minimal state, which he argues should serve 
as a "night-watchman" state with a limited role in society. He asserts, "The minimal state limited to the 
narrow functions of protection against force, theft, fraud, enforcement of contracts, and so on, is inspiring 
as well as right." This minimal state's primary duty is to safeguard individuals' rights to life, liberty, and 
property, without intervening in extensive regulatory or redistributive activities. This concept aligns with 
Nozick's belief that the role of the state should be minimal to avoid infringing upon individuals' entitlements. 
 
While Nozick's entitlement theory provides a clear and coherent framework for understanding justice, it has 
been the subject of extensive debate and criticism. Critics argue that it may result in extreme economic 
inequalities and insufficiently address systemic issues related to wealth distribution and social justice. 
Nonetheless, Nozick's work continues to influence discussions on political philosophy and justice theory, 
offering a distinctive perspective rooted in individual rights and property entitlements. 
 

Q.5) How has Rawls enriched the idea of justice in liberalism? (20 Marks) (2021) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Rawls' influence on liberal political philosophy with his "A Theory of Justice," 

emphasizing his innovative ideas of justice as fairness and the original position. 
Body:  
• Explain Rawls' use of the original position and the veil of ignorance to derive his two principles of justice, 

focusing on how these principles address freedom and equality in a novel manner that seeks to rectify 
classical liberalism's flaws. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the impact of Rawls' theory on contemporary liberal thought, highlighting its role in shaping 

ongoing discussions about justice, equality, and the role of the state in ensuring both. 
 
John Rawls significantly enriched the idea of justice within liberalism through his seminal work, "A Theory of 
Justice" (1971), where he introduced the concepts of justice as fairness and the original position, 
fundamentally reshaping liberal political philosophy. Rawls's theory sought to address and remedy the 
perceived shortcomings of classical liberalism, particularly concerning the distribution of wealth and 
opportunities within society. He proposed a model of justice that combined freedom and equality in a novel 
and compelling way, setting a new standard for liberal political thought. 
 
Rawls introduced the original position and the veil of ignorance as a thought experiment to determine the 
principles of justice that rational and self-interested individuals would choose for the society they are going to 
live in, without knowing their place in it. This methodological innovation ensures that the principles selected 
are fair and impartial, as individuals do not know whether they will be advantaged or disadvantaged in society. 
Rawls believed that under these conditions, individuals would choose two principles of justice: (1) each person 
is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar

system of liberty for all, and (2) social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (a) 
to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to 
offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity. 
 
By prioritizing the rights and liberties of individuals while simultaneously addressing inequalities through the 
difference principle, Rawls offered a robust defense of social justice that extends beyond the traditional liberal 
focus on individual freedoms. His theory articulates a vision of a well-ordered society in which the liberties of 
equal citizenship are guaranteed, and the distribution of income and wealth, and opportunities for positions 
of responsibility, are arranged to benefit the most disadvantaged members of society. 
 
Rawls's work has inspired a wide range of discussions, critiques, and extensions in political philosophy, 
influencing thinkers across the political spectrum. His conception of justice as fairness has become a central 
reference point for debates on equality, rights, and the role of government in redistributing resources. 
Through his innovative use of the original position and the veil of ignorance, Rawls effectively bridged the gap 
between the values of freedom and equality, offering a vision of liberalism that is more attuned to the 
complexities of social justice and the demands of a pluralistic society. 
 
In conclusion, John Rawls enriched the idea of justice in liberalism by providing a powerful and persuasive 
account of how societies can be structured to reflect fairness, equality, and liberty. His contributions have 
profoundly influenced contemporary liberal thought, prompting ongoing debates and discussions about the 
nature of justice and the best ways to achieve it in complex, modern societies. 
 

Q.6) Examine Communitarian Perspectives on Justice. (15 Marks) (2019) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the communitarian critique of liberal justice theories, emphasizing the importance of 

community values and shared traditions in understanding justice. 
Body:  
• Discuss key communitarian thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Sandel, their critiques of liberal 

individualism, and their arguments for integrating community values and the common good into the 
concept of justice. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the communitarian perspective’s impact on political philosophy, highlighting its challenge 

to liberal ideologies and its advocacy for balancing individual rights with communal responsibilities.  
 
Communitarian perspectives on justice represent a distinctive and influential strand of political philosophy 
that challenges conventional liberal theories. Thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre and Michael Sandel argue that 
justice should be understood within the context of community values and shared traditions, placing an 
emphasis on the collective over individual autonomy.  
 
MacIntyre, in his work "After Virtue," laments the erosion of moral coherence in societies that prioritize 
individualism over shared community values. Communitarians stress the cultural embeddedness of moral

values, contending that justice cannot be abstracted from specific cultural contexts. This perspective engages 
in the ongoing debate over cultural relativism, asserting that moral judgments are inseparable from the 
cultural traditions that give them meaning. 
 
A significant aspect of communitarian thought is its critique of liberal theories of justice, particularly the 
influential work of John Rawls in "A Theory of Justice." Communitarians, such as Michael Sandel, argue that 
liberal ideologies place excessive emphasis on individual rights and neglect the importance of community and 
shared values. Sandel's critique in "Liberalism and the Limits of Justice" questions the neutrality of liberal 
principles and their inadequacy in addressing moral and cultural diversity. 
 
Communitarians also highlight the concept of the common good as central to justice, emphasizing that justice 
goes beyond the distribution of resources and opportunities to encompass policies and practices that benefit 
the entire community. This perspective challenges the reduction of justice to the aggregation of individual 
preferences and aligns with early ethical thought like Aristotle's notion of eudaimonia, where the common 
good is paramount. 
 
Moreover, communitarian perspectives underscore the need for a balance between individual rights and 
communal responsibilities. Scholars like Charles Taylor advocate for recognizing and accommodating diverse 
cultural identities within societies, striking a balance between individual rights and collective recognition. 
Taylor's work on multiculturalism and the politics of recognition emphasizes this equilibrium. 
 
Finally, communitarians often endorse forms of democratic deliberation that prioritize dialogue and 
consensus-building within communities. These deliberative processes aim to arrive at just decisions that align 
with community values and aspirations, reflecting the communitarian commitment to inclusive and 
participatory decision-making. 
 
In conclusion, communitarian perspectives on justice challenge prevailing liberal paradigms by emphasizing 
the importance of community values, cultural context, and the common good. Scholars like MacIntyre, Sandel, 
Taylor, and others call for a reevaluation of the balance between individual rights and collective 
responsibilities, advocating for a deeper recognition of cultural diversity and an inclusive approach to 
democratic decision-making. Communitarianism offers a valuable and thought-provoking perspective in 
contemporary discussions of justice and the role of community in shaping our ethical and political landscapes.

PSIR By Vivek Waghmare  

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how communitarian critiques provide a substantial challenge to liberal conceptions of 

justice, advocating for a balance between individual rights and communal responsibilities. 
 
In the critiques of Communitarian theorists, justice is explicated in a manner that fundamentally challenges 
the traditional liberal conceptions of justice. Scholars like Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel, and Charles 
Taylor argue for a community-centered understanding of justice. MacIntyre, in his influential work "After 
Virtue," contends that justice is inseparable from a specific community's values and traditions.  
 
This perspective posits that justice cannot be universally defined but must be viewed within the unique 
context of each community. As MacIntyre states, "Each of us is born into a specific historical and cultural 
setting," emphasizing the cultural embeddedness of moral concepts. This critique challenges the notion of a 
universal, one-size-fits-all conception of justice prevalent in liberal thought. 
 
Moreover, Communitarian theorists critique the prevailing individualism in liberal theories of justice. Michael 
Sandel, in "Liberalism and the Limits of Justice," questions whether justice can be fully realized by focusing 
solely on individual rights without considering the needs and values of the community. Communitarians argue 
that the relentless prioritization of individual autonomy and rights neglects the collective dimensions of 
justice, undermining the common good. This critique highlights the tension between individual liberties and 
the well-being of the community. 
 
Communitarians also underscore the cultural embeddedness of moral values and justice. They argue that 
moral principles are deeply rooted in specific cultural contexts and traditions. Charles Taylor's work on 
multiculturalism and the politics of recognition emphasizes that justice cannot be detached from the cultural 
norms that give it meaning. This perspective challenges the universality of liberal principles and underscores 
the importance of cultural diversity in shaping conceptions of justice. Taylor's assertion that "The idea of the 
good is not something waiting out there to be discovered" underscores the culturally contingent nature of 
moral concepts. 
Additionally, Communitarians stress the idea of the common good as an integral aspect of justice. Justice, in 
this view, goes beyond the protection of individual rights to encompass policies and practices that benefit the 
entire community. This perspective challenges the reduction of justice to the mere aggregation of individual 
preferences and calls for a broader consideration of what serves the collective well-being. Communitarians 
argue that a focus on the common good is essential for achieving true justice. 
 
Finally, Communitarian perspectives call for a balance between individual rights and communal 
responsibilities. Scholars like Charles Taylor argue for recognizing and accommodating diverse cultural 
identities within a society, striking a balance that ensures justice is not one-sided, favoring individual claims 
over the needs and values of the community. This balance reflects the communitarian commitment to a more 
nuanced and inclusive approach to justice. 
 
The critiques of Communitarian theorists offer an explication of justice that challenges traditional liberal 
conceptions. They emphasize community-centered justice, cultural embeddedness, the common good, and 
the need to balance individual rights with communal responsibilities. These critiques invite a reevaluation of 
justice that takes into account the unique context of each community, cultural diversity, and the collective 
dimensions of well-being, providing a valuable counterpoint to conventional liberal theories of justice.

Q.8) Rawls Theory is both contractual and distributive. Examine (2017) (15) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Rawls' theory from "A Theory of Justice" as a pivotal development in modern political 

philosophy, focusing on its contractual and distributive elements to reconcile liberty and equality. 
Body:  
• Detail the contractual basis of Rawls' theory through the original position and the veil of ignorance, and 

discuss the distributive principles concerning how societal goods and opportunities should be allocated, 
particularly the difference principle. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the influence and debate surrounding Rawls' theory, highlighting its impact on political 

philosophy and public policy discussions. 
 
John Rawls' theory, primarily articulated in his influential work "A Theory of Justice," is a significant 
contribution to modern political philosophy and is characterized by its contractual and distributive elements. 
This theory seeks to reconcile the principles of liberty and equality in a systematic way through what Rawls 
terms "justice as fairness." 
 
The contractual aspect of Rawls' theory is evident in his use of the social contract tradition, which he revises 
and updates for the 20th century. Unlike classical social contract theorists like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, 
who theorized about the origins of society and the state, Rawls is more concerned with the principles of justice 
that would be chosen in a hypothetical contract. He introduces the original position and the veil of ignorance 
as thought experiments to determine what principles rational and impartial individuals would choose to 
govern the basic structure of society. In the original position, individuals do not know their place in society, 
their class position, or social status, thereby ensuring that the principles chosen are fair and impartial. 
 
The distributive aspect of Rawls' theory concerns how goods and opportunities are distributed in society. 
Rawls proposes two principles of justice: the first principle guarantees the right to basic liberties for all (e.g., 
freedom of speech, assembly), and the second principle, known as the difference principle, contends that 
social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the 
least advantaged and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of 
opportunity. This second principle reflects Rawls' approach to distributive justice, which is not about ensuring 
an equal distribution of wealth and resources, but rather ensuring that inequalities work to the benefit of the 
least advantaged in society. 
 
Rawls' theory has been influential but also the subject of much debate. Libertarian scholars like Robert Nozick 
have critiqued Rawls for what they see as an unjustified infringement on individual rights by redistributive 
policies. In contrast, more egalitarian philosophers, like G.A. Cohen, have argued that Rawls does not go far 
enough in addressing the deep-seated structural inequalities in society. 
In practical terms, Rawls' theory has had a significant impact on discussions of public policy, especially in areas 
such as welfare, taxation, and the regulation of economic markets. His approach provides a framework for 
thinking about how to balance the competing demands of ensuring individual freedoms and addressing social 
and economic inequalities.

Rawls' theory of justice is both contractual and distributive. It offers a unique framework for considering the 
principles that would underlie a just society, combining the traditional social contract theory with a distinct 
approach to distributive justice. While it has been subject to various critiques, Rawls’ work remains a central 
reference point in debates over justice, fairness, and public policy in contemporary political philosophy. 
 

Q.9) Analyze the Rawlsian justification of discrimination to achieve goals of social justice. (2018) (15) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce John Rawls as a prominent thinker whose theories offer a framework for understanding social 

justice, particularly in terms of fairness and equality, and address how his ideas intersect with concepts 
of affirmative action. 

Body:  
• Explain Rawls's two principles of justice, focusing on the difference principle and how it provides a 

justification for affirmative action to correct historical injustices and ensure equitable resource 
distribution. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of distinguishing between Rawls's advocacy for equitable policies and 

traditional discrimination, emphasizing the ongoing relevance and debate surrounding his ideas in 
modern discussions on social justice. 

 
John Rawls, one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century, offers a sophisticated 
framework for thinking about social justice through his seminal works, "A Theory of Justice" (1971) and 
"Political Liberalism" (1993). Rawls's theory, often characterized by its focus on fairness and equality, does not 
directly advocate for "discrimination" in the conventional understanding of the term, which implies unjust or 
prejudicial treatment based on arbitrary distinctions. Instead, Rawls proposes a theoretical justification for 
certain kinds of differential treatment designed to correct historical injustices and to ensure a more equitable 
distribution of resources and opportunities, which might be construed as a form of "affirmative action" rather 
than discrimination. 
 
At the heart of Rawls's theory are two principles of justice: the first guarantees equal basic liberties for all, and 
the second, known as the difference principle, permits social and economic inequalities only if they benefit 
the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's idea of "justice as fairness" is encapsulated in the original 
position, a hypothetical scenario where individuals choose principles of justice behind a "veil of ignorance," 
unaware of their own place in society. This thought experiment ensures that the principles chosen are fair and 
impartial since no one can tailor the principles to benefit their specific condition. 
 
The difference principle is particularly relevant to discussions about affirmative action and the justification for 
policies that might resemble discrimination in favor of historically marginalized or disadvantaged groups. 
According to Rawls, a just society is one that works to improve the situation of those who are least well off. In 
contexts where systemic injustices have led to significant disparities in wealth, opportunity, and power, 
policies that aim to rectify these imbalances align with Rawlsian justice, even if they involve preferential 
treatment for certain groups.

It's essential to differentiate between Rawls's theoretical justification for affirmative action and what is 
traditionally understood as discrimination. Rawlsian affirmative action aims to create a more level playing 
field, acknowledging that the social and economic inequalities resulting from arbitrary factors like race, 
gender, or family background are unjust. This approach seeks to ensure that all individuals have a fair chance 
to develop their talents and to participate fully in society. 
 
Critics of Rawls, from both the left and the right, have raised concerns about the practical implications of 
implementing his principles, particularly the difference principle. Some argue that focusing on the least 
advantaged could stifle economic efficiency or innovation, while others contend that Rawls does not go far 
enough in addressing structural inequalities. Despite these debates, Rawls's work remains a cornerstone of 
contemporary discussions on social justice, offering a robust philosophical foundation for considering the 
ethics of affirmative action and other policies aimed at achieving greater social equality. 
 
In conclusion, John Rawls's justification for differential treatment to achieve social justice goals is rooted in his 
commitment to fairness and equality. While not advocating for discrimination in its negative sense, Rawls 
provides a moral and philosophical rationale for affirmative action policies designed to correct historical 
injustices and to ensure that the least advantaged members of society benefit from social and economic 
arrangements. His theoretical framework invites ongoing reflection and debate about the best means to 
achieve a just and equitable society.

• Summarize the significance of Rawls’s contribution to political philosophy and the ongoing debates it 

inspires, noting both the strengths of his fairness-based approach and the critiques that underscore its 
practical limitations 

 
John Rawls's argument for democratic equality is a central component of his broader theory of justice, most 
comprehensively presented in his landmark work, "A Theory of Justice" (1971). Rawls's philosophy revolves 
around two key principles of justice: the first principle guarantees the equal basic liberties for all citizens, and 
the second principle, known as the difference principle, stipulates that social and economic inequalities are to 
be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society and 
(b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.

Rawls's advocacy for democratic equality is grounded in the concept of the "original position" and the "veil of 
ignorance." In the original position, hypothetical rational agents deliberate about the principles of justice that 
should govern the basic structure of society without knowledge of their own place in it. The veil of ignorance 
conceals from these agents their personal characteristics, social status, and natural endowments, ensuring 
that the principles chosen are just and impartial. Rawls argues that under these conditions, rational agents 
would unanimously adopt his two principles of justice, thereby establishing a framework for democratic 
equality. 
 
The strength of Rawls's argument lies in its rigorous attempt to ground principles of justice in fairness and 
impartiality. By hypothetically removing all knowledge of personal circumstances, Rawls aims to derive 
principles that rational individuals would consider fair and acceptable regardless of their position in society. 
This methodological approach seeks to justify democratic equality not as a matter of social contract but as a 
consequence of a fair agreement under conditions of equality. 
 
However, Rawls's theory has been subject to critical examination from various perspectives. Critics argue that 
the original position and the veil of ignorance, while innovative, are overly abstract and detach the principles 
of justice from the complexities of real-world social and political life. Communitarians like Michael Sandel, in 
"Liberalism and the Limits of Justice" (1982), criticize Rawls for abstracting from the communal contexts that 
give individuals' lives their meaning, suggesting that this leads to a conception of the self that is too atomistic 
and detached from its social and communal ties. 
 
Another line of critique comes from feminists who argue that Rawls's framework does not adequately address 
gender inequality. Susan Moller Okin, in "Justice, Gender, and the Family" (1989), contends that Rawls's 
theory, by focusing on the distribution of goods and opportunities in the public sphere, overlooks the 
inequalities and power imbalances within the family, a fundamental institution of society. 
 
Moreover, critics from the standpoint of multiculturalism and post-colonial studies question the applicability 
of Rawls's principles to societies that do not share the same liberal democratic traditions. They argue that 
Rawls's model presupposes a degree of cultural homogeneity and may not easily accommodate the pluralistic 
and diverse nature of many contemporary societies. 
 
In conclusion, John Rawls's argument for democratic equality through his two principles of justice represents 
a seminal contribution to political philosophy. His attempt to justify principles of justice on the basis of fairness 
and impartiality offers a compelling vision of a just society. However, the critical debates surrounding his 
theory reflect the challenges of applying his abstract principles to the complexities of real-world social and 
political contexts, highlighting the ongoing dialogue between Rawlsian theory and its critics in the pursuit of a 
more just and equitable society.

Q.11) Rawl's idea of 'liberal self' is too individualistic. Explain, in this context, the communitarian critique of 
Rawl's theory of Justice. (15 Marks) (2023) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Present John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" as a seminal work that defines justice through individual 

rights and equality, highlighting the critiques it faces from communitarian thinkers regarding the 
conceptualization of the "liberal self." 

Body:  
• Discuss the key criticisms from communitarian scholars like Michael Sandel, Charles Taylor, and Alasdair 

MacIntyre, who argue that Rawls’s model is too detached from the communal and social contexts that 
shape individual identities and moral obligations. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of these critiques in the broader debate on justice, emphasizing how they 

challenge Rawls’s principles to incorporate a more holistic view of individual identity within community 
settings.  

 
John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" (1971) is a foundational text in contemporary political philosophy, 
introducing the principles of justice as fairness, which prioritize individual rights and liberties, equality of 
opportunity, and a distributive criterion for socioeconomic inequalities. Rawls envisions the "liberal self" as 
rational and autonomous, capable of formulating and revising a conception of the good life. This view of the 
self underpins his original position and veil of ignorance, theoretical tools designed to ensure impartiality in 
the principles of justice chosen by rational actors. However, Rawls's conceptualization of the self has drawn 
significant critique from communitarian scholars, who argue that it is overly individualistic and neglects the 
importance of community and social relations in shaping individual identity and values. 
 
Communitarians like Michael Sandel, Charles Taylor, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Michael Walzer challenge the 
notion of the abstract, detached liberal self posited by Rawls. They argue that Rawls's theory overlooks the 
extent to which individuals are embedded in social contexts and defined by their participation in various 
communities. According to communitarians, individuals' identities, values, and conceptions of the good are 
deeply influenced by their cultural, social, and historical contexts. 
 
Michael Sandel, in "Liberalism and the Limits of Justice" (1982), critiques Rawls for what he perceives as the 
decontextualized and unencumbered view of the self. Sandel contends that by abstracting from the social and 
communal ties that constitute our identity, Rawls's model of the self fails to account for the moral and ethical 
obligations inherent in these relationships. For Sandel and other communitarians, justice cannot be 
understood or achieved without considering the communal contexts that shape individuals' preferences, 
values, and obligations. 
 
Charles Taylor expands on this critique by emphasizing the role of common goods and shared values in defining 
a community. In works like "Sources of the Self" (1989), Taylor argues that understanding human morality and 
justice requires acknowledging the collective goals and goods that give life meaning and shape individual 
aspirations. From this perspective, Rawls's emphasis on individual choice and autonomy overlooks the 
communal dimension of human life, which is essential for a full understanding of justice.

Alasdair MacIntyre, in "After Virtue" (1981), further critiques the liberal conception of the self for its neglect 
of tradition and virtue ethics. MacIntyre posits that ethical reasoning and moral conduct are inextricably linked 
to the traditions and practices of specific communities, challenging the universalist assumptions underlying 
Rawls's theory of justice. 
 
The communitarian critique raises important considerations about the balance between individual rights and 
the communal bonds that underpin social cohesion and collective well-being. While communitarians do not 
deny the importance of individual rights, they argue for a more nuanced understanding of justice that 
incorporates the value of community, shared practices, and social relationships. 
 
In response to these critiques, Rawls and others have sought to clarify and, in some cases, revise their theories 
to address concerns about the social embeddedness of individuals and the importance of communal ties. The 
ongoing dialogue between liberal and communitarian thinkers reflects the complexity of reconciling individual 
autonomy with the communal contexts that shape and sustain our lives, contributing to a richer and more 
nuanced debate about the nature of justice in diverse societies. 
 

Q.12) Make a comparative assessment of Greek perspective of Justice with the Rawlsian concept of justice. 
(2020) (20) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the concept of justice as a vital theme in philosophy, highlighting the dialogues between 

ancient Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle and modern theorists like John Rawls. 
Body:  
• Explore the distinct approaches to justice presented by Plato and Aristotle, emphasizing their focus on 

virtue, merit, and the common good, contrasted with Rawls's principles of justice as fairness derived 
from a hypothetical original position and veil of ignorance. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the contributions and differences between the Greek and Rawlsian perspectives on justice, 

noting how these theories provide foundational insights into the ethical and structural organization of 
society. 

 
The concept of justice has been a central theme in both ancient Greek philosophy and modern political theory, 
offering rich perspectives that have shaped the Western understanding of justice and its role in society. When 
comparing the Greek perspective of justice, particularly as articulated by Plato and Aristotle, with the Rawlsian 
concept of justice as fairness, we find both convergences and divergences in their philosophical frameworks 
and implications for political and social organization. 
 
Plato, in his work "The Republic," presents justice as a fundamental virtue of both individuals and the state. 
For Plato, a just society is one in which each class performs its designated role in accordance with its nature: 
the ruling class (philosopher-kings), the auxiliaries (warriors), and the producers (farmers, artisans, etc.). 
Justice emerges when each class harmoniously contributes to the whole, adhering to the principle of 
specialization. Plato's justice is inherently linked to the idea of the common good and the harmonious order 
of the polis.

Aristotle, on the other hand, expands on the notion of justice in "Nicomachean Ethics," distinguishing between 
distributive justice (the fair distribution of goods among members of the community based on merit) and 
corrective justice (the rectification of wrongful actions in transactions). For Aristotle, justice involves 
proportionality and equality, but equality not in an absolute sense but rather according to merit or 
contribution to the community. Aristotle's view emphasizes the ethical and moral dimensions of justice, 
focusing on achieving a balanced and virtuous society. 
 
John Rawls, a 20th-century American philosopher, introduces a contemporary concept of justice in "A Theory 
of Justice" (1971), which he terms "justice as fairness." Rawls's theory is grounded in the social contract 
tradition, proposing two principles of justice derived from the original position and the veil of ignorance—a 
hypothetical scenario where individuals do not know their place in society. The first principle guarantees equal 
basic liberties for all, while the second (the difference principle) allows for social and economic inequalities 
only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's concept of justice emphasizes the need 
for a fair system of cooperation and the protection of individual rights within a democratic framework. 
 
Comparatively, both the Greek perspective and Rawls's theory view justice as essential to the functioning and 
stability of society. However, the Greeks, especially Plato, envision a hierarchical but harmonious society 
where justice is tied to the common good and the natural order of things. Aristotle introduces a more 
individualized notion of justice that considers merit and contribution. In contrast, Rawls focuses on ensuring 
fairness and equality of opportunity within a liberal democratic context, emphasizing the importance of 
designing institutions that protect the most vulnerable and ensure a fair distribution of resources. 
 
Another critical difference lies in the methodology and foundation of their theories. The Greeks rely on a 
teleological approach, viewing justice as part of the natural and cosmic order, whereas Rawls employs a 
contractualist approach, using rational choice theory to determine principles of justice that free and equal 
persons would agree to under conditions of fairness. 
 
In summary, the comparative assessment of Greek perspectives of justice and the Rawlsian concept reveals 
both traditions' rich contributions to the understanding of justice. While they differ in their conceptualizations 
and methodologies, both aim to elucidate the conditions under which justice and the good life can be achieved 
in society. The dialogue between these perspectives continues to enrich contemporary debates on justice, 
equality, and the best ways to organize society.
