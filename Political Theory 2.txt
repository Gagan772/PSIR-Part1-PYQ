Q.10) Comment on: The Post-Behavioural Approach. (10) (2016) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the Post-Behavioural Approach as a response to behaviouralism, highlighting its emphasis on 

reintroducing normative concerns and relevance to societal issues. 
Body: 
• Discuss David Easton's advocacy for a balanced approach between empirical rigor and ethical 

engagement, and explore how this philosophy has influenced developments in areas like feminist 
political analysis and new institutionalism. 

Conclusion: 
• Summarize the impact of the Post-Behavioural Approach on political science, emphasizing its role in 

making the discipline more ethically aware and responsive to societal needs. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach in political science emerged as a response to the perceived limitations of the 
behaviouralism movement, which emphasized empirical, statistical, and often quantitative methods in the 
study of political phenomena. Post-behaviouralism, crystallizing in the late 1960s and early 1970s, sought to 
reintroduce normative concerns, ethical judgments, and a focus on addressing real-world problems into 
political science. This shift was partly a reaction to societal upheavals, including civil rights movements and

anti-war protests, which highlighted the need for political science to be more directly relevant to societal 
issues and ethical considerations. 
 
David Easton, a key figure in this transition, articulated the need for a “post-behavioural revolution” in his 
1969 presidential address to the American Political Science Association. He advocated for a balance between 
rigorous scientific methods and the pursuit of relevance to public policy and moral concerns. Easton’s call for 
a science that is both empirically sound and directly engaged with the values and issues of society reflects the 
core of the post-behavioural critique. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach emphasizes the importance of values in political research, arguing that science 
cannot be value-free, especially when it comes to studying human behavior and societal structures. It 
encourages scholars to not only describe and analyze political phenomena but also to engage with questions 
of what ought to be, combining empirical research with normative theory. This approach has fostered a more 
holistic understanding of political phenomena, integrating insights from various disciplines and perspectives. 
 
The influence of post-behaviouralism can be seen in the subsequent development of critical theories, feminist 
political analysis, and the new institutionalism, all of which underscore the importance of considering values, 
power dynamics, and the broader societal context in political science research. By advocating for a science 
that is more attuned to the complexities of political life and the ethical dimensions of political action, the Post-
Behavioural Approach has enriched the field, making it more responsive to the challenges and needs of 
society. 
 
The Post-Behavioural Approach represents a significant shift in political science, highlighting the discipline's 
engagement with ethical concerns and real-world relevance. It serves as a reminder of the importance of 
balancing methodological rigor with the pursuit of knowledge that is meaningful and beneficial to society.

Introduction: 
• Introduce John Plamenatz's assertion that political theory is a demanding intellectual pursuit, not an 

escape from the complexities of real-world politics. 
Body: 
• Explain Plamenatz's critique of viewing political theory as escapism and elaborate on his portrayal of it 

as an "arduous calling" that requires deep engagement and rigorous analysis. 
Conclusion: 
• Summarize the impact of Plamenatz's view on political theory, emphasizing its role in fostering 

informed, ethical engagement with political realities.  
 
John Plamenatz's assertion, "political theory is not an escape mechanism but an arduous calling," resonates 
profoundly within the realm of political thought. This statement underscores that political theory should not 
be perceived as a refuge from the complexities of real-world politics but rather as a demanding intellectual 
pursuit.

Firstly, Plamenatz's assertion challenges the notion that political theory serves as a means of escapism. In this 
context, escapism refers to the idea that individuals might turn to political theory as a way to avoid engaging 
with the complexities and challenges of real-world politics and governance. Instead, Plamenatz argues that 
political theory is fundamentally grounded in reality and should be seen as a discipline that confronts, 
analyzes, and seeks to understand these complexities. Political theory, in this view, is not an intellectual 
retreat but a pathway to deeper engagement with the political world. 
 
Secondly, by characterizing political theory as an "arduous calling," Plamenatz highlights the rigorous and 
demanding nature of this discipline. This view aligns with the perspective that political theory is not a passive 
academic pursuit but a vocation that requires dedication and intellectual rigor. Scholars in this field are tasked 
with exploring intricate ideas, ideologies, and systems, often wrestling with complex moral and ethical 
questions. In essence, it suggests that political theorists have a responsibility to delve deeply into these 
matters, recognizing that their work can have a profound impact on political thought and action. 
 
To complement this analysis, it's worth noting the views of other prominent political theorists. Hannah Arendt, 
for example, emphasized the importance of active political engagement when she said, "The sad truth is that 
most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil." Arendt's perspective aligns 
with Plamenatz's assertion in the sense that political theory should not be a passive endeavor but should 
motivate individuals to make informed and ethical choices in the political sphere. 
 
In conclusion, John Plamenatz's statement underscores the notion that political theory is not a form of 
escapism but rather a demanding and morally significant intellectual pursuit. It challenges scholars and 
thinkers to engage deeply with political realities and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of politics 
and governance. Ultimately, it highlights the importance of recognizing political theory as a discipline that can 
shape the course of political thought and action, emphasizing its responsibility and impact on society. 
 

Q.12) Examine the importance of behavioural approach in political theory. What led to its decline? (15 Marks) 
(2021) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the behavioral approach in political science as a transformative movement from the 1950s 

and 1960s that emphasized empirical research and quantitative methods. 
Body: 
• Detail the contributions of key scholars like David Easton, Robert Dahl, and Gabriel Almond, and discuss 

the criticisms and philosophical challenges that led to the decline of the behavioral approach. 
Conclusion: 
• Summarize the lasting impact of the behavioral approach on political science, highlighting its role in 

introducing methodological rigor and shaping contemporary political analysis. 
 
The behavioral approach in political science, which emerged prominently in the 1950s and 1960s, marked a 
transformative period in the discipline by emphasizing empirical research, the use of statistical methods, and 
the study of political behavior from a scientific perspective. This approach sought to ground political science

in the analysis of observable behavior and quantifiable data, moving away from the normative and often 
philosophical focus of traditional political theory. 
 
Key scholars who were instrumental in the development and advancement of the behavioral approach include 
David Easton, Robert Dahl, and Gabriel Almond. David Easton, for instance, was pivotal in promoting a systems 
theory approach to understanding political structures and functions, aiming to create a more scientifically 
grounded basis for political analysis. Robert Dahl's work on pluralism and his analysis of power structures in 
democracy were also foundational, providing empirical insights into how power and decision-making are 
distributed in democratic societies. Gabriel Almond contributed significantly with his comparative politics 
studies, particularly through the development of the structural-functional framework, which offered a new 
way to compare political systems across different cultures and historical contexts. 
 
The decline of the behavioral approach can be attributed to several criticisms and shifts in the field. One major 
critique was its perceived overemphasis on quantitative methods and statistical analysis, which some argued 
could not fully capture the complexity, depth, and nuance of political phenomena. Critics pointed out that 
politics, at its core, involves human values, beliefs, and emotions, which are difficult to quantify or model 
statistically. 
 
Moreover, the rise of postmodernism and critical theory in the latter part of the 20th century challenged the 
positivist underpinnings of the behavioral approach. Scholars like Michel Foucault and Jürgen Habermas 
questioned the assumptions of objectivity and neutrality in social sciences, arguing that power relations and 
social constructs play a crucial role in shaping knowledge and scientific inquiry. This philosophical critique led 
to a broader reevaluation of the methods and goals of political science, advocating for approaches that 
recognized the importance of interpretive methods, the role of ideology, and the influence of culture and 
identity in politics. 
 
Despite these critiques and its decline in dominance, the behavioral approach has had a lasting impact on 
political science. It introduced rigorous methodological standards, fostered interdisciplinary research, and 
expanded the tools available for political analysis. The legacy of the behavioral approach continues to 
influence how researchers study voting behavior, public opinion, and other aspects of political life, ensuring 
its place as a vital chapter in the history of the discipline. 
 

Q.13) Decline of Political theory. (10 Marks) (2023)

Body: 
• Discuss the criticisms from scholars like Sheldon S. Wolin and John G. Gunnell regarding the 

transformation of political theory into a more technical and methodologically driven discipline, and

explore contemporary responses that demonstrate the ongoing relevance and evolution of political 
theory. 

Conclusion: 
• Summarize the resilience and continued importance of political theory in addressing complex modern 

issues, emphasizing its vital role in enriching political discourse and understanding. 
 
The perceived decline of political theory has been a subject of considerable debate among scholars and 
practitioners within the field of political science. This discourse revolves around concerns that traditional 
political theory, with its focus on normative questions, historical texts, and philosophical inquiries into the 
nature of justice, democracy, and governance, has been marginalized within the broader discipline. Critics 
argue that this trend reflects a shift towards empirical and quantitative methods at the expense of critical, 
normative, and qualitative approaches to understanding political life. 
 
One of the seminal voices in the discussion of this phenomenon was Sheldon S. Wolin, who in his influential 
essay "Political Theory as a Vocation" (1969), lamented the transformation of political theory into a technical 
discipline that prioritized methodological rigor over the exploration of substantive political questions. Wolin 
criticized the growing dominance of behavioralism in political science, which he saw as reducing the 
complexity of political phenomena to quantifiable variables and statistical models, thereby sidelining the 
critical and speculative essence of political theory. 
 
Similarly, John G. Gunnell, in works such as "The Decline of Political Theory," reflects on the historical 
development of the discipline and critiques the narrowing of political theory’s scope in the face of the 
professionalization and scientization of political science. Gunnell argues that this trend not only diminishes 
the role of political theory but also impoverishes the discipline's capacity to engage with the normative 
foundations of political life and the enduring questions of political philosophy. 
 
The debate over the decline of political theory also touches on the tension between the so-called "two 
cultures" in political science: the empirical/positivist culture that seeks to explain and predict political 
phenomena through the application of scientific methods, and the normative/interpretative culture that aims 
to understand the meanings and values underlying political practices and institutions. This tension reflects 
broader epistemological and methodological divides within the social sciences. 
 
Despite these concerns, it is important to note that political theory has not disappeared but has evolved in 
response to new challenges and intellectual currents. Contemporary political theory engages with a wide 
range of issues, including identity politics, multiculturalism, global justice, environmental ethics, and the 
impact of technology on society. Theorists like Nancy Fraser, Charles Taylor, and Martha Nussbaum, among 
others, have contributed significantly to these debates, demonstrating the continued relevance and vitality of 
political theory in addressing the complex issues of our time. 
 
Furthermore, the revival of interest in normative political theory, particularly in the context of global and 
transnational challenges, suggests that the field remains a crucial part of political science. This resurgence is 
evident in the interdisciplinary dialogue between political theory and other fields, such as philosophy, law, 
economics, and cultural studies, enriching both the theoretical and empirical study of politics.

In conclusion, while concerns about the decline of political theory reflect legitimate anxieties about the 
discipline's direction, the continued engagement with normative questions and the exploration of new 
theoretical frontiers indicate that political theory remains an indispensable part of political science. Its capacity 
to critique, envision, and illuminate the ethical dimensions of political life ensures its ongoing relevance and 
importance. 
 

Q.14) 'Credo of Relevance' in post-behaviouralism advocates the importance of action sccience. Analyze. (15 
Marks) (2023) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Introduce the 'Credo of Relevance' in post-behaviouralism as a response to the limitations of 

behavioralism's focus on empirical analysis, advocating for political science to address societal issues. 
Body: 
• Discuss David Easton's role in promoting this shift towards practical relevance in political science, 

outlining the principles of action science and its application in engaging with real-world problems. 
Conclusion: 
• Summarize the impact and challenges of adopting the 'Credo of Relevance,' emphasizing its potential 

to make political science more impactful and relevant to societal needs. 
 
The 'Credo of Relevance' in post-behaviouralism emerged as a critique of the behavioural approach in political 
science, which was primarily focused on the empirical and quantitative analysis of political behavior, often at 
the expense of addressing pressing societal issues. Post-behaviouralism, which gained prominence in the late 
1960s and early 1970s, advocates for a political science that is not only scientifically rigorous but also directly 
engaged with the problems facing society. The 'Credo of Relevance' emphasizes the need for political science 
to be relevant to the real world, advocating for research that leads to action or what is often termed as "action 
science." 
 
David Easton, a key figure in the development of post-behaviouralism, played a crucial role in articulating this 
shift towards relevance in political science. In his 1969 presidential address to the American Political Science 
Association, titled "The New Revolution in Political Science," Easton called for a political science that addresses 
the urgent concerns of society, emphasizing the importance of combining empirical research with normative 
inquiry to inform policy and action. Easton argued that political scientists should not remain detached 
observers but should actively engage with societal issues, using their research to inform decisions and policies 
that address social injustices, inequality, and other critical challenges. 
 
The 'Credo of Relevance' and the call for action science reflect a broader concern with making academic 
research impactful beyond the confines of academia. Action science, in this context, refers to a research 
approach that involves collaboration between researchers and practitioners to co-create knowledge that can 
directly inform and improve practice. It emphasizes problem-solving, participatory methods, and the 
application of research findings to real-world issues.

This shift towards relevance and action has led to a more engaged and interdisciplinary approach to political 
science, where scholars work on projects that have tangible outcomes for communities and policy-making. 
Examples include participatory action research projects that involve communities in the research process, 
policy analysis that informs governmental decision-making, and collaborative research projects that bring 
together academics, practitioners, and activists to address specific societal issues. 
 
However, the emphasis on relevance and action science has also sparked debates within the discipline. Critics 
argue that the pursuit of relevance might compromise scientific objectivity and lead to politicization of the 
field. Others contend that the complexity of social problems requires the integration of empirical research 
with normative and critical analysis, and that political science has a responsibility to contribute to the 
betterment of society. 
 
In conclusion, the 'Credo of Relevance' in post-behaviouralism represents a significant shift in political science 
towards engaging more directly with societal issues through action science. It underscores the importance of 
research that is not only methodologically sound but also socially relevant, aiming to bridge the gap between 
theory and practice. While this approach presents challenges, it also offers opportunities for political science 
to make meaningful contributions to addressing the pressing concerns of contemporary society. 
 

Q.15) Eurocentrism is both the target and the motive force of the post-colonial political theory. Discuss. (15 
Marks) (2023) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction: 
• Begin by stating the central role of Eurocentrism in post-colonial political theory, emphasizing its 

function as both a subject of critique and a catalyst for theoretical exploration. 
Body:  
• Outline key contributions from scholars like Edward Said, Homi K. Bhabha, and Gayatri Chakravorty 

Spivak, discussing how their works challenge Eurocentric narratives and contribute to understanding 
cultural interactions and power dynamics. Highlight the dual aspect of Eurocentrism as both oppressive 
and motivating within post-colonial discourse. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize by reaffirming the significance of challenging Eurocentrism in post-colonial theory, focusing 

on its role in reshaping global narratives and advocating for a more equitable world order.  
 
Eurocentrism, the inclination to consider European (and, by extension, Western) culture, values, and 
perspectives as universal standards, plays a dual role in post-colonial political theory as both its target and its 
motive force. Post-colonial theory critically addresses the legacy of colonialism, including the dominance of 
Eurocentric viewpoints that have historically marginalized non-Western cultures, knowledge systems, and 
perspectives. By challenging Eurocentrism, post-colonial theory seeks to deconstruct the hierarchies and 
binary oppositions established during colonial rule and continued in the global order. 
 
Edward Said's seminal work, "Orientalism" (1978), illustrates how Eurocentrism has shaped Western 
perceptions of the East, constructing it as the "Other" – exotic, backward, and fundamentally different. Said's 
analysis reveals how such representations served to justify colonial domination and continue to influence

contemporary cultural and political relations. Orientalism, as Said demonstrates, is a manifestation of 
Eurocentrism, whereby the West defines itself as the norm against which all other cultures are measured and 
often found wanting. 
Post-colonial theorists like Homi K. Bhabha and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak further interrogate the 
mechanisms of Eurocentrism. Bhabha, in works such as "The Location of Culture" (1994), explores the concept 
of hybridity, challenging the binary thinking of colonizer/colonized and suggesting that cultural exchange 
under colonialism was marked by mutual influence and the creation of new, hybrid identities. This challenges 
the Eurocentric narrative of cultural purity and superiority. Spivak, meanwhile, in "Can the Subaltern Speak?" 
(1988), critiques the ways in which Eurocentric discourses silence subaltern voices, arguing for the importance 
of listening to and amplifying marginalized perspectives. 
 
At the same time, Eurocentrism serves as a motive force for post-colonial political theory, propelling its efforts 
to rethink and reformulate political, cultural, and historical narratives. The critique of Eurocentrism motivates 
a re-examination of global history, encouraging the recognition and valorization of non-Western forms of 
knowledge, governance, and modes of resistance. This endeavor is not only about countering Eurocentrism 
but also about reconstructing identities and sovereignties that were suppressed or altered by colonial rule. 
 
Moreover, the engagement with Eurocentrism is instrumental in post-colonial theory's critique of 
contemporary global inequalities and neocolonial practices, which are often rooted in Eurocentric 
assumptions about development, progress, and civilization. This critical stance is essential for advocating for 
a more equitable world order that respects cultural diversity and fosters genuine intercultural dialogue and 
cooperation. 
 
In conclusion, Eurocentrism is both the target and the motive force of post-colonial political theory. As a target, 
it represents the entrenched biases and inequalities that post-colonial theory seeks to expose and dismantle. 
As a motive force, it galvanizes the search for alternative narratives and epistemologies that can contribute to 
a more inclusive and just global society. The critique of Eurocentrism is thus central to the project of post-
colonial theory, driving its analysis of the past and its vision for the future.

Postmodernism represents a complex, multifaceted critique of foundational assumptions and grand narratives 
that have characterized Western thought, art, culture, and politics since the Enlightenment. Emerging 
prominently in the latter half of the 20th century, postmodernism challenges the notions of objective truth, 
universal values, and the inevitability of progress, advocating instead for an understanding of reality as 
fragmented, subjective, and constructed through language and power dynamics. It spans various disciplines, 
including literature, art, architecture, philosophy, and sociology, each field contributing its unique perspective 
to the postmodern critique. 
 
One of the key figures in postmodern philosophy is Jean-François Lyotard, who in "The Postmodern Condition: 
A Report on Knowledge" (1979), famously defined postmodernism as "incredulity towards metanarratives." 
Metanarratives, according to Lyotard, are overarching, universal stories or theories that claim to explain 
various aspects of human life and history (such as the Enlightenment belief in reason, Marxism's history of 
class struggle, or Christianity's salvation history). Postmodernism, in rejecting these narratives, emphasizes 
the plurality of perspectives and the localized, contingent nature of knowledge and truth. 
 
Michel Foucault, another pivotal postmodern thinker, explored how power and knowledge are intertwined, 
suggesting that what societies come to accept as truth is the result of power relations and discursive practices. 
In works like "Discipline and Punish" (1975) and "The History of Sexuality" (1976), Foucault analyzes how 
institutions and discourses construct subjects and regulate bodies, thereby questioning the possibility of 
objective knowledge outside of these power/knowledge systems. 
 
In the realm of art and architecture, postmodernism is associated with a departure from the modernist 
emphasis on purity, simplicity, and functionality, towards a playful, eclectic use of styles, symbols, and 
historical references. Architects like Robert Venturi and Philip Johnson, and artists like Andy Warhol, exemplify 
the postmodern aesthetic, which often incorporates parody, pastiche, and a blending of high and low culture. 
 
Critics of postmodernism argue that its rejection of universal truths and objective standards can lead to 
relativism and nihilism, undermining the basis for critical evaluation, moral judgment, and political action. For 
instance, Jürgen Habermas criticized postmodernism for abandoning the Enlightenment project of using 
reason to advance human emancipation, while others worry that postmodernism's focus on language and 
discourse overlooks material conditions and economic inequalities. 
 
Despite these critiques, postmodernism has had a profound impact on contemporary thought, challenging 
individuals and societies to reconsider how they understand truth, identity, and reality. It has opened up 
spaces for marginalized voices and alternative narratives, enriching cultural and intellectual landscapes with a 
diversity of perspectives. In doing so, postmodernism continues to influence debates on everything from 
literary criticism and art to politics, ethics, and the nature of knowledge itself. 
 
In summary, postmodernism represents a critical departure from the certainties and universals of modernist 
thought, emphasizing the fragmented, constructed, and contingent nature of reality. Through its critique of 
metanarratives, exploration of power relations, and playful aesthetic strategies, postmodernism challenges 
conventional ways of seeing the world and encourages a deeper engagement with the complexities of 
contemporary life.

Q.17) Trace the evolution of western political thought from ancient to contemporary period. (2020) (20) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Outline the evolution of Western political thought from ancient to contemporary times, emphasizing 

its philosophical diversity and historical context. 
Body:  
• Examine key eras and thinkers: Ancient Greece's foundational theories, Medieval Christian influence, 

Renaissance pragmatism, Early Modern sovereignty concepts, Enlightenment ideals, and modern 
ideological debates. 

Conclusion:  
• Highlight the continuous impact of these evolving ideas on current political theories and global 

challenges, underscoring the enduring relevance of Western political thought. 
 
The evolution of Western political thought is a rich tapestry woven from diverse philosophical traditions, 
historical contexts, and intellectual revolutions. This journey from the ancient period to contemporary times 
reflects an ongoing dialogue about governance, justice, liberty, and the nature of political community. 
 
Ancient Period: 
Western political thought began in ancient Greece, where philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle laid 
the foundational ideas of political theory. Plato, in his work "The Republic," envisioned an ideal state governed 
by philosopher-kings, emphasizing the role of justice and the virtues in political life. Aristotle, in "Politics," took 
a more empirical approach, analyzing different forms of government and advocating for a mixed constitution 
as the most stable form of governance. He emphasized the importance of the polis (city-state) for achieving 
the good life. 
 
Medieval Period: 
The fall of the Western Roman Empire led to the medieval period, where Christian theology deeply influenced 
political thought. St. Augustine, in "The City of God," contrasted the earthly city with the heavenly city, 
emphasizing the temporal nature of political power and the superiority of divine authority. Later, St. Thomas 
Aquinas synthesized Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology, arguing that natural law and reason could 
guide political governance, laying the groundwork for later developments in natural rights theory. 
 
Renaissance and Reformation: 
The Renaissance sparked a revival of interest in classical antiquity, accompanied by challenges to the medieval 
order. Niccolò Machiavelli, in "The Prince," broke with previous ideals by arguing that political leaders must 
be pragmatic and, at times, ruthless to maintain power and stability. The Reformation further fragmented the 
European political landscape, leading to new reflections on sovereignty and the relationship between church 
and state, as seen in the work of Martin Luther and John Calvin. 
 
Early Modern Period: 
The early modern period saw significant developments in the conception of sovereignty and rights. Thomas 
Hobbes, in "Leviathan," presented a stark view of human nature and the need for absolute sovereignty to 
prevent societal collapse into a "war of all against all." John Locke countered with a more optimistic view in

PSIR By Vivek Waghmare  

"Two Treatises of Government," advocating for natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and the idea of 
government as a social contract with the consent of the governed. 
 
Enlightenment: 
The Enlightenment furthered the exploration of liberty, democracy, and justice. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in 
"The Social Contract," argued for the sovereignty of the general will and the importance of direct democracy. 
Montesquieu's "The Spirit of the Laws" introduced the separation of powers as a means to prevent tyranny. 
These ideas significantly influenced the American and French revolutions, embedding Enlightenment ideals in 
the political structures of emerging democratic states. 
 
19th and 20th Centuries: 
The 19th and 20th centuries were marked by the rise of ideologies like liberalism, conservatism, socialism, and 
nationalism. Karl Marx critiqued capitalist societies and proposed a revolutionary theory of class struggle, 
aiming for a classless society. In contrast, John Stuart Mill expanded on liberal principles in "On Liberty," 
emphasizing individual freedom and the harm principle. 
 
Contemporary Period: 
Contemporary political thought grapples with globalization, multiculturalism, environmentalism, and 
challenges to democracy. John Rawls's "A Theory of Justice" reintroduced the importance of fairness and 
egalitarian principles in political philosophy. Meanwhile, theorists like Robert Nozick and Michael Walzer have 
engaged in debates over justice, community, and the role of the state in addressing inequality and recognizing 
cultural diversity. 
 
The evolution of Western political thought reflects an ongoing engagement with the fundamental questions 
of political life: the best form of government, the nature of justice and liberty, and the rights and duties of 
citizens. From the ancient city-states of Greece to the complex global landscape of the contemporary period, 
the development of political theory continues to be shaped by historical events, cultural transformations, and 
intellectual debates, illustrating the dynamic interplay between ideas and the political realities they seek to 
address.
