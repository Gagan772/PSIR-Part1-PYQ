### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"From Plato's philosopher-kings to Rawls's veil of ignorance, Western political thought is a 2,500-year conversation where each generation adds its voice—sometimes harmonizing with the past, sometimes arguing fiercely, but always grappling with the same eternal questions: Who should rule? What is justice? How should we live together?—proving that political theory is not a museum of dead ideas but a living laboratory where humanity's best minds continue their urgent search for the good political life."*
