### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Antonio Gramsci's notion of 'organic intellectuals' from his 'Prison Notebooks'—distinguishing them from traditional intellectuals who claim autonomous neutrality as organic intellectuals emerge directly from and remain intimately connected to working class, articulating and disseminating class values, aims, and interests ('every social group creates together with itself, organically, one or more strata of intellectuals who give it homogeneity and awareness of its function'), playing crucial role in creating counter-hegemony by working within civil society institutions (media, education, religion) to educate, persuade, mobilize masses, cultivating collective will essential for working class developing consciousness of its position and potential to reorganize social order—demonstrates contemporary relevance extending beyond Marxism to feminist movements (Gloria Steinem, Bell hooks), environmentalism (Wangari Maathai, Vandana Shiva), civil rights struggles (MLK, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks), positioning intellectuals not as detached observers but as active agents of cultural and political transformation bridging theory and practice, teaching that social change requires leadership from within oppressed communities articulating alternative visions challenging dominant hegemony through intellectual and moral guidance."*

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Antonio Gramsci's argument that hegemony is primarily based on 'organization of consent'—challenging traditional Marxist focus on coercion by revealing how ruling class projects its worldview so thoroughly it becomes accepted common sense through civil society institutions (media, schools, churches, cultural organizations) manufacturing voluntary subordinate class 'agreement' to leadership, achieving what Gramsci describes as 'combination of force and consent balancing each other reciprocally without force predominating excessively'—offers nuanced understanding of power in capitalist societies where domination operates not mainly through police/military but through cultural and ideological shaping of consciousness, making existing social order appear natural and best possible, yet because power is diffuse and consent never total or uncontested, this creates spaces for counter-hegemonic struggles where subordinate groups can challenge dominant narratives with intellectuals playing crucial role articulating alternative visions galvanizing masses toward transformation, teaching that revolutionary change requires not just seizing state apparatus but winning 'war of position' in cultural and ideological spheres, constructing new common sense challenging ruling class's hegemonic worldview."*

## Q3. Explain, as per Gramsci, the distinction between hegemony and domination. (2013) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Gramsci's distinction in "Prison Notebooks" between hegemony (ruling class predominance through consensual acceptance of values/ideologies/cultural norms as 'common sense,' winning consent via cultural/ideological leadership shaping worldview—"supremacy manifests as 'domination' and as 'intellectual and moral leadership'") and domination (control through state's coercive apparatuses: police, military, judicial system, securing obedience by fear/suppression not consent) expands Marxist understanding beyond economics to culture/ideology/civil society, suggesting struggle must occur at ideas/culture level, recognizing hegemony never total, constantly negotiated, opening space for "counter-hegemony."

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Hegemony vs domination` | `Gramsci Prison Notebooks` | `Consensual acceptance` | `Cultural ideological leadership` | `Common sense` | `Coercive apparatuses` | `Police military judicial` | `Fear suppression` | `Counter-hegemony` | `Civil society struggle`

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"Gramsci's distinction between hegemony and domination—articulated in 'Prison Notebooks' as 'supremacy of social group manifests in two ways: as domination and as intellectual and moral leadership'—reveals that ruling class maintains power not primarily through coercive state apparatuses (police, military, judicial system securing obedience by fear/suppression) but through hegemony's consensual acceptance of values/ideologies/cultural norms making ruling class worldview 'common sense' for all classes via cultural and ideological leadership shaping consciousness and limiting imagination of alternatives, expanding Marxist understanding beyond economic structures to include culture, ideology, civil society, suggesting transformative struggle must occur at ideas/culture level not just economic/political confrontation, while recognizing hegemony never total but constantly negotiated/contested/remade, acknowledging subordinate classes' agency and opening space for 'counter-hegemony' where subaltern groups develop cultural/ideological resources challenging dominant leadership—teaching that stable governance relies more on hegemonic practices than domination, consent proves more powerful than force but also more vulnerable to counter-hegemonic challenges from civil society constructing alternative narratives and practices."*
