2 Theories of State 
 
 

Q.1) Make an assessment of the post-colonial understanding of State. (2011) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Outline the post-colonial perspective on state development, focusing on how colonial legacies continue 

to influence contemporary political structures and identities. 
Body:  
• Discuss key contributions from scholars like Frantz Fanon and Homi K. Bhabha, addressing the 

psychological, cultural, and structural challenges in post-colonial states as reflected in their works. 
Highlight empirical studies that reveal ongoing governance and economic issues. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of recognizing colonial impacts in understanding post-colonial state 

dynamics and the necessity for informed, nuanced policy-making that addresses these complex 
legacies.  

 
The post-colonial understanding of the state is a complex field that critically examines how colonial legacies 
shape contemporary state structures, political identities, and power dynamics in formerly colonized countries. 
This understanding shifts away from Eurocentric perspectives, emphasizing the unique political, social, and 
economic challenges these states face due to their colonial pasts. 
 
Prominent scholars like Frantz Fanon and Homi K. Bhabha have significantly contributed to the discourse. 
Fanon, in his seminal work "The Wretched of the Earth," discusses the psychological and cultural upheavals 
that accompany decolonization, arguing that the newly independent states often replicate colonial power 
structures, perpetuating cycles of violence and oppression. Fanon’s insights reveal the inner conflicts of post-
colonial societies, noting, “Decolonization is always a violent event,” which underscores the tumultuous 
transformations these societies undergo. His critique extends to the national bourgeoisie, which he accuses 
of taking the colonizer’s place, thus failing to alter the fundamental social structures. 
 
Homi K. Bhabha further explores the cultural dimensions of post-colonial states, focusing on the concept of 
hybridity and the negotiation of cultural identity. His theories suggest that post-colonial identities are 
produced in a complex interplay of cultural signifiers that resist the binary oppositions often imposed by 
colonial narratives. In "The Location of Culture," Bhabha asserts that cultural production in post-colonial 
spaces is a process of "cultural translation," a concept that helps understand the state’s role in mediating and 
sometimes mitigating various cultural demands and identities. 
 
Empirical analyses, such as those presented in studies of democratic consolidation in post-colonial states, 
often show a pattern of instability and struggle. For instance, data from the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) 
Project illustrate how post-colonial states face significant challenges in achieving stable, effective, and 
inclusive governance. This is partly due to the artificial borders created by colonial powers, which

amalgamated disparate ethnic and cultural groups under single state administrations without regard to pre-
existing social, cultural, or political boundaries. 
 
Additionally, the economic policies of post-colonial states have often been influenced by the demands of 
global economic structures, which can be traced back to colonial extractive policies. Scholars like Walter 
Rodney in "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" have argued that colonialism left a legacy of economic 
exploitation that continued to affect the economic policies and development trajectories of these states long 
after independence. 
 
In summary, the post-colonial understanding of the state emphasizes the enduring impact of colonialism on 
state formation, political identity, and power relations. It challenges the narrative of a clean break with the 
past, showing instead a continuity of colonial structures and struggles. This perspective not only reshapes our 
understanding of state and society in the post-colonial world but also highlights the need for nuanced policies 
and approaches that recognize the deep-seated influences of colonial history in the current geopolitical and 
cultural landscapes. 
 

Q.2) What is meant by ‘relative autonomy’ of State in Marxist analysis? (2012) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the Marxist concept of the 'relative autonomy' of the state, explaining its role within the 

capitalist system and its degree of independence from capitalist classes. 
Body:  
• Discuss the evolution of the idea from classical Marxism to Nicos Poulantzas's contributions, illustrating 

how the state balances interests to stabilize and legitimize capitalism, sometimes through reforms that 
superficially oppose capitalist norms. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how the concept of 'relative autonomy' provides insight into the state's complex role in 

capitalist societies, emphasizing its ability to act independently to maintain the system's long-term 
viability. 

 
In Marxist analysis, the concept of the 'relative autonomy' of the state refers to the idea that while the state 
functions within the parameters set by capitalist class interests, it also maintains a degree of independence 
from these classes. This independence allows it to act in ways that may not always directly reflect the 
immediate interests of the dominant class but still ultimately preserve the capitalist system. 
 
This concept addresses a key debate in Marxist theory about the role and nature of the state in capitalist 
societies. Classical Marxists, like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, originally posited that the state is a direct 
instrument of the bourgeoisie, used to enforce its interests and maintain its dominance. However, later 
Marxists developed the notion of 'relative autonomy' to explain how the state can also pass reforms that 
appear to be against capitalist interests, like labor laws and environmental regulations, which, in reality, help 
to stabilize and legitimize the capitalist system in the long term.

Nicos Poulantzas, a prominent Marxist theorist, significantly contributed to this concept. In his work "State, 
Power, Socialism," Poulantzas argued that the state possesses its own material base and thus must be 
understood as more than just a reflection of economic relations. He stated, "The capitalist state must, while 
being a capitalist state, nevertheless be relatively autonomous from the dominant class or fraction of capital." 
This autonomy is crucial for maintaining a general interest in a capitalist society, which might involve balancing 
conflicting interests among various capitalist factions or between capitalists and workers to maintain order 
and the continued functioning of the system. 
 
Poulantzas’s argument extends to the idea that the state, by seeming to stand above class struggles and 
appearing to represent a universal interest, enhances its legitimacy and the overall stability of capitalist 
society. This appearance is crucial in managing and containing class conflicts, thereby preventing challenges 
to the capitalist order. 
 
Furthermore, empirical observations of state behavior, such as the implementation of welfare programs or 
regulatory measures that restrict specific capitalist practices, can be interpreted through this lens. These 
actions might seem to contradict the immediate interests of capital but are understood within Marxist theory 
as strategies by the state to preserve the long-term health and stability of the capitalist system. 
 
Thus, the concept of 'relative autonomy' in Marxist analysis helps explain the complex, sometimes 
contradictory role of the state within capitalist societies. It highlights that while the state operates within a 
framework favorable to capitalist interests, it also has its own bureaucratic momentum and imperatives that 
can lead to actions not directly dictated by any single class interest. This theoretical framework is pivotal for 
understanding the nuanced ways in which state power is exercised in modern capitalist societies. 
 

Q.3) Examine the challenges to sovereignty of the State in the contemporary world (15) (2015) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Highlight the changing concept of state sovereignty in response to global political, economic, and 

technological advancements, noting its shift from absolute to conditional. 
Body:  
• Discuss contributions from scholars like Keohane, Nye, and Nussbaum on the impact of international 

institutions and cosmopolitan ethics; explore internal sovereignty challenges through the works of 
Kymlicka and Buchanan; and address globalization's effects as analyzed by Appadurai and governance 
theories by Ostrom and Sorensen. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how these scholarly insights and practical challenges necessitate a flexible approach to state 

sovereignty in the modern interconnected world.  
 
In the contemporary world, the notion of state sovereignty, traditionally signifying a state's supreme authority 
over its territory and internal matters, is significantly challenged by various global, political, economic, and 
technological advancements. As political scientist Robert O. Keohane articulates, sovereignty has transformed 
from an absolute to a conditional concept, dependent on a state's ability to adapt to the complexities of an

interconnected globe. The traditional Westphalian sovereignty system is increasingly under pressure from 
transnational and supranational forces, highlighting a shift away from a state-centric paradigm. 
 
Scholars like Keohane and Joseph Nye, champions of neoliberal institutionalism, point to the growing influence 
of international institutions and non-state actors, illustrating how multinational corporations and 
organizations like the United Nations extend their reach beyond state boundaries, thereby reshaping global 
order. This aligns with cosmopolitan thinkers like Martha Nussbaum, who advocate for prioritizing global 
responsibilities over narrow state interests through global governance mechanisms to tackle issues such as 
poverty and human rights, underpinning their arguments with ethical considerations. 
 
Moreover, internal diversity within states often leads to sub-national challenges and secessionism. The 
scholarship of Will Kymlicka on multiculturalism and minority rights, alongside Allen Buchanan's work on the 
ethics of secession, sheds light on the internal complexities states face, as seen in Quebec, Canada, and 
Catalonia's quest for independence from Spain. These cases underscore the tensions between traditional state 
sovereignty and the aspirations of sub-national groups. 
 
The phenomenon of globalization and deterritorialization, as discussed by Arjun Appadurai, further 
complicates state sovereignty by diluting territorial boundaries through the global flow of information, culture, 
and finance, exemplified by challenges such as cyber warfare. Additionally, the theories of hybrid and 
multilevel governance, introduced by scholars like Elinor Ostrom and Eva Sørensen, recognize the 
collaborative efforts of state and non-state actors in tackling complex global issues, with the European Union's 
governance structure serving as a prime example of such collaboration. 
 
The insights from scholars like Keohane, Nye, Kymlicka, Buchanan, and Appadurai, coupled with various 
theories and practical examples, highlight the multifaceted challenges to state sovereignty in the modern era. 
The interaction between transnational forces, the dynamics of multiculturalism, the impacts of globalization, 
and the emergence of novel governance models underscores the necessity for states to adopt flexible 
strategies. These strategies are essential for navigating the evolving global landscape while striving to preserve 
the core aspects of state sovereignty. 
 

Q.4) Examine the liberal theory of State in contemporary politics. (2022) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Present the liberal theory of state as a continuing influence in contemporary politics, emphasizing its 

core principles and contributions from theorists like John Locke and John Rawls. 
Body:  
• Discuss the foundational ideas from Locke on government by consent and Rawls's theory of justice, and 

how these shape current liberal states. Highlight contemporary applications and debates around 
economic regulation, social welfare, and civil liberties. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the ongoing significance of liberal theory in shaping modern political systems and its role in 

addressing current challenges like globalization and political polarization.

The liberal theory of state in contemporary politics continues to be a significant framework, shaping the 
governance and political ideologies of many nations. Rooted in the principles of individual liberty, equality 
before the law, democratic governance, and the protection of private property, liberalism as a political theory 
advocates for a state structure that maximizes individual freedom while ensuring order and justice. The works 
of scholars such as John Locke, who emphasized the importance of consent of the governed and natural rights, 
and John Rawls, who further developed the concept of justice as fairness, provide foundational perspectives 
for understanding the liberal state's role and responsibilities. 
 
John Locke's assertion that the state exists to preserve life, liberty, and property has profoundly influenced 
liberal democratic thought. His idea that government power derives from the consent of the governed 
underpins the modern liberal democratic system, which prioritizes the protection of individual rights and the 
provision of public goods necessary for a free and equal society. This consent is typically manifested through 
free and fair elections, ensuring that the government's authority is legitimately derived from the people it 
serves. 
 
John Rawls's contribution to liberalism, particularly through his theory of justice as fairness, emphasizes a state 
that not only protects individual liberties but also ensures social and economic inequalities are arranged to 
benefit the least advantaged members of society. This principle, outlined in "A Theory of Justice," supports a 
contemporary understanding of the liberal state that engages in redistributive policies to achieve a more 
equitable society, while still respecting the foundational liberal principle of individual rights. 
 
In contemporary politics, the liberal theory of state manifests through the advocacy for democratic 
institutions, the rule of law, and the protection of civil liberties and human rights. It informs debates on 
government intervention in the economy, with liberals typically supporting regulations and policies that 
ensure fair competition and protect against the abuses of market power, while also advocating for social 
welfare programs to address inequalities. 
 
However, the liberal theory of state faces challenges in the contemporary era, including debates over the 
extent of government intervention in the economy, the balance between national security and individual 
privacy, and the management of cultural and social diversity within the framework of liberal democracy. 
Globalization, the rise of populism, and increasing political polarization pose additional challenges, testing the 
resilience and adaptability of liberal institutions. 
 
Despite these challenges, the liberal theory of state remains a foundational element of contemporary politics, 
advocating for a political order that seeks to harmonize individual freedom with social justice and equality. Its 
principles continue to inspire movements for democracy and human rights around the world, reflecting the 
enduring appeal and relevance of liberalism in addressing the complexities of modern political life.

Q.5) Comment on: Neo-liberal perspective of State. (10) (2017) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Outline the neoliberal perspective of the state, emphasizing its preference for minimal government 

intervention and market-driven economies, and its global influence on economic policies. 
Body:  
• Discuss the contributions of key proponents like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, the application 

of neoliberal policies in countries like Chile, and address criticisms from scholars like Joseph Stiglitz 
regarding economic inequality and other negative impacts. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the ongoing debate around neoliberalism, noting its significant influence on global 

economic governance and the contrasting views on its benefits and drawbacks.  
 
The neoliberal perspective of the state, championing minimal government intervention and free-market 
capitalism, has been influential in shaping economic policies worldwide. Milton Friedman succinctly 
summarized this viewpoint, stating, "The free market system distributes the fruits of economic progress 
among all people."  
 
This ideology promotes the idea that limited government regulation leads to economic efficiency, innovation, 
and prosperity. Neoliberalism's emphasis on individualism and personal responsibility aligns with the belief 
that individuals should have the freedom to make economic choices without excessive government 
interference. 
 
Scholars like Friedrich Hayek have played instrumental roles in advocating for this ideology, as evidenced by 
Hayek's work, "The Road to Serfdom." They argue that central planning and government control lead to 
inefficiencies and a loss of individual freedom. The neoliberal perspective often points to success stories like 
the economic transformation of countries such as Chile, which implemented neoliberal reforms under the 
Pinochet regime, as evidence of its efficacy. 
 
However, neoliberalism is not without its critics. Scholars like Joseph Stiglitz have raised concerns about the 
impact of neoliberal policies on economic inequality. They highlight how deregulation and reduced social 
safety nets can disproportionately benefit the wealthy while leaving vulnerable populations at a disadvantage. 
The global financial crisis of 2008, exacerbated by a lack of regulation in the financial sector, serves as a stark 
example of the potential pitfalls of unbridled neoliberalism. Furthermore, critics argue that the prioritization 
of profit over social and environmental concerns can lead to detrimental consequences for society and the 
planet. 
 
Despite these critiques, neoliberalism has left an indelible mark on the global economic landscape, influencing 
policies, institutions, and trade agreements. It remains a subject of intense debate, with proponents lauding 
its potential to drive economic growth and critics highlighting the need for more balanced and socially 
responsible economic policies. In an interconnected world, the neoliberal perspective of the state continues 
to be a defining force, shaping the way governments approach economic governance and the role they play 
in their nations' economies.

Theories related to Neo-Liberalism 
• Free Market Capitalism: Neoliberalism advocates for minimal government intervention in the economy 

and the promotion of free-market capitalism. It aligns with the idea that markets, if left to operate 
freely, will efficiently allocate resources and create economic prosperity. 

• Public Choice Theory: Public choice theory, associated with scholars like James M. Buchanan, is often 
linked to neoliberalism. It explores how individuals make decisions in the political sphere and how these 
decisions can be influenced by self-interest, rational choice, and economic incentives. 

• Rational Choice Theory: Neoliberalism is also connected to rational choice theory, which posits that 
individuals make decisions based on rational calculations of costs and benefits, including in their 
interactions with the state. 

 
Q.6) Comment on: Feminist critique of the State (2021) (10 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the feminist critiques of the state as articulated by scholars like Simone de Beauvoir, bell 

hooks, and Judith Butler, focusing on how these critiques expose the perpetuation of gender 
inequalities by political institutions. 

Body:  
• Explore the specific arguments of de Beauvoir on women's "otherness," hooks on the state's inadequate 

response to gender-based violence, and Butler's critique of state-regulated gender identities. Reference 
practical issues like reproductive rights to illustrate the impact of these critiques. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of feminist critiques in highlighting systemic gender inequalities within the 

state and their role in pushing for necessary legal and policy changes to promote gender equality. 
 
Feminist critiques of the state, as advanced by scholars like Simone de Beauvoir, bell hooks, and Judith Butler, 
provide insightful perspectives on the ways in which political institutions perpetuate gender-based inequalities 
and reinforce patriarchal power structures.  
 
Simone de Beauvoir, in her groundbreaking work "The Second Sex," highlighted how women have been 
historically defined in relation to men, emphasizing their "otherness" within the state and society. She argued 
that this relegation of women to a secondary status is deeply ingrained in the structure of the state. 
 
Bell hooks, in "Feminism Is for Everybody," points out how the state's response to issues like domestic 
violence and sexual harassment has often been insufficient, reflecting a systemic disregard for women's well-
being. She stresses the importance of the state's role in addressing these issues effectively, urging for a more 
proactive stance in combating gender-based violence. 
 
Judith Butler, known for her work on gender performativity, questions the state's regulation of gender 
identities and expressions. She argues that state-sanctioned categories of gender limit individual freedom and 
expression, emphasizing the state's role in enforcing normative gender roles.

An illustrative example of a feminist critique of the state can be seen in reproductive rights. Activists like 
Margaret Sanger and contemporary organizations like Planned Parenthood have long fought for women's 
autonomy over their bodies. They have critiqued state-imposed restrictions on abortion and contraception, 
arguing that these limitations infringe upon women's reproductive rights and perpetuate patriarchal control. 
These critiques have led to legal battles and policy changes aimed at securing women's reproductive freedom. 
Feminist critiques of the state shed light on the systemic gender inequalities embedded within political 
institutions. These critiques serve as a call to action, urging the state to address these issues and strive for 
gender equality. As de Beauvoir, hooks, and Butler have shown, understanding the complex interplay 
between the state and gender dynamics is essential for advancing women's rights and social justice. 
 

Q.7) Comment on: Post-colonial theory of the State (10 Marks) (2020) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Outline the Post-colonial theory of the State as a tool to analyze the complexities and legacies of 

colonialism in shaping modern post-colonial states, referencing scholars like Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, 
and Homi Bhabha. 

Body:  
• Explore key themes such as the psychological and cultural impacts of colonialism as described by Fanon, 

the political and ethnic conflicts stemming from artificial colonial borders, economic dependencies on 
former colonial powers, and the influence of global powers as critiqued by Said. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how Post-colonial theory not only reveals the challenges faced by post-colonial states due 

to historical legacies but also highlights their resilience and ongoing efforts toward self-determination 
and identity formation.  

 
The Post-colonial theory of the State, as developed by influential scholars such as Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, 
and Homi Bhabha, offers a critical lens to understand the intricate dynamics of countries emerging from 
colonial rule.  
 
Fanon's words resonate strongly in this context: "Colonialism is not satisfied merely with holding a people in 
its grip and emptying the native's brain of all form and content. By a kind of perverted logic, it turns to the 
past of the oppressed people, and distorts, disfigures, and destroys it." 
 
This theory sheds light on the enduring legacies of colonialism, which often continue to shape post-colonial 
states. For example, many African nations grapple with artificial colonial borders that have led to political and 
ethnic conflicts. Nigeria's ethnic tensions, rooted in colonial-era divisions, and the Rwandan genocide, a result 
of colonial-era classifications, are poignant examples. 
 
The economic aspect is equally significant. Post-colonial states often struggle with economic dependency on 
former colonial powers or international financial institutions. This can be observed in the economic policies 
imposed on countries like Zimbabwe or the influence of multinational corporations in resource-rich nations 
like the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Edward Said's critique of neocolonialism resonates as well, especially in today's globalized world. International 
institutions and powerful countries exert substantial influence over post-colonial states, impacting their 
sovereignty. For instance, debates on trade agreements and foreign aid often reveal the power imbalances 
between post-colonial states and their former colonizers or international actors. 
 
Despite these challenges, post-colonial theory also highlights resilience and agency. Movements for self-
determination and decolonization, seen in the struggles of countries like India and Ghana, have played a 
pivotal role in shaping the identity and trajectory of post-colonial states. 
 
The Post-colonial theory of the State provides a vital framework for comprehending the complexities faced by 
countries emerging from colonialism. It underscores the enduring impact of colonial legacies on issues such as 
borders, economic dependency, and sovereignty. Moreover, it recognizes the agency and resilience of post-
colonial states in forging their identities and confronting the challenges posed by neocolonial forces. 
 

Q.8) Comment on: Pluralist theory of the State. (10 Marks) (2019) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Pluralist theory of the State, emphasizing its view of governance as a competitive arena where 

diverse interest groups vie for influence within a democratic framework. 
Body:  
• Discuss key concepts and critiques of Pluralist theory, citing scholars like Robert Dahl, C. Wright Mills, 

and G. William Domhoff, along with challenges posed by populist movements and the criticisms 
regarding the concentration of power among elites. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how Pluralist theory provides insights into the functioning of democracies and the ongoing 

debates about the distribution of power and the role of interest groups in political decision-making. 
 
Pluralist theory of the State, as expounded by influential scholars like Robert Dahl and David Truman, offers a 
perspective on governance that recognizes the presence of diverse interest groups, each vying for influence 
and power within a democratic framework.  
 
Robert Dahl, in his seminal work "Who Governs?" asserts, "The process of governing is the process of 
deciding who gets what, when, and how." This perspective underscores the idea that power is dispersed and 
decision-making involves negotiations among various interest groups. 
 
Interest groups compete for influence over government decisions. They do so through various means, 
including lobbying, advocacy, and public campaigns(Arthur Bentley). Pluralists see the state as an impartial 
mediator that facilitates negotiations and compromises among interest groups.  
 
However, C. Wright Mills criticised the pluralist model in his work "The Power Elite," arguing that true power 
in society was concentrated among a small, interconnected elite comprising political, corporate, and military 
leaders. G. William Domhoff research on the U.S. power structure challenges pluralism. In "Who Rules 
America?" he emphasizes the role of an upper class that wields significant economic and political

power. Robert Michels coined the "Iron Law of Oligarchy" to highlight how even democratic organizations 
tend to be dominated by a few elites. Hannah Arendt criticized pluralism's tendency to divide society into 
isolated interest groups. 
 
Additionally, the rise of populist movements in various parts of the world challenges the pluralist view by 
emphasizing the role of charismatic leaders and direct appeals to the masses, potentially bypassing traditional 
interest groups. 
 
Pluralist theory of the State provides a valuable lens for understanding democratic governance, where diverse 
interest groups actively participate in decision-making processes. While it accurately portrays the complexity 
of modern democracies, ongoing debates center on the extent to which power is truly dispersed and whether 
certain interests maintain disproportionate influence, especially in an era of evolving political dynamics. 
 

Q.9) Discuss in what sense Max’s understanding of state can be considered as materialistic. (15) (2013) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Karl Marx's materialistic perspective on the state, which sees it as deeply entwined with the 

economic conditions and class structures of society. 
Body:  
• Detail Marx's view of the state as an instrument of the ruling class, citing the "Communist Manifesto" 

and discussing his theory of historical materialism. Examine how changes in the mode of production 
influence the state's role and structure. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize Marx's vision of the state's eventual dissolution in a communist society, emphasizing the 

central role of economic factors in shaping state functions and structures according to his materialist 
conception of history. 

 
Karl Marx's understanding of the state is fundamentally materialistic, grounded in his broader materialist 
conception of history and society. This materialism is characterized by the belief that the material conditions 
of society—the economic base, including the modes of production and the relations of production—determine 
the social, political, and intellectual life processes. Marx famously stated, "The history of all hitherto existing 
society is the history of class struggles," highlighting his view that material interests, particularly those rooted 
in economic class divisions, are the primary drivers of social and political life. 
 
In Marx's analysis, the state is seen not as an autonomous entity serving the common interest but as a tool for 
maintaining the interests and power of the ruling class. In the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Friedrich 
Engels assert that "The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of 
the whole bourgeoisie." This statement encapsulates Marx's view that the state's laws, policies, and 
institutions are designed to reflect and reinforce the economic interests of the capitalist class (the bourgeoisie) 
at the expense of the working class (the proletariat). 
 
Marx's materialistic understanding of the state also underpins his theory of historical materialism, which posits 
that the evolution of societies through different historical stages (e.g., feudalism, capitalism, socialism) is

driven by changes in the material conditions of life, specifically the development of the forces of production. 
The state's role and structure are seen as directly linked to these material conditions, changing as the mode 
of production evolves. Thus, under capitalism, the state functions to protect private property and uphold the 
conditions necessary for capitalist production, including the suppression of class conflict through its monopoly 
on violence. 
 
Furthermore, Marx envisages the eventual dissolution of the state in a communist society. In his critique of 
the Gotha Program, Marx describes a future society where the state, as a tool of class oppression, "withers 
away," replaced by a classless, stateless society organized on the principle of "from each according to his 
ability, to each according to his needs." This vision reflects his materialistic belief that political structures are 
contingent upon economic relations; as the latter are radically transformed towards a communal mode of 
production, the need for the state's coercive apparatus disappears. 
 
In summary, Marx's materialistic understanding of the state is rooted in his broader materialist conception of 
history, where the economic base of society fundamentally shapes its political superstructure, including the 
state. The state, in Marx's analysis, functions primarily to perpetuate the interests and power of the ruling 
economic class, with its form and functions evolving in line with changes in the mode of production. Marx's 
analysis emphasizes the primacy of material (especially economic) factors in determining the character and 
evolution of state structures. 
 

Q.10) Discuss feminist theory of state. (10) (2016) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the feminist theory of the state as an analytical framework that critiques how state 

institutions and policies perpetuate gender inequalities and patriarchal norms. 
Body:  
• Discuss key contributions by Carole Pateman, Catherine MacKinnon, and Nancy Fraser, examining their 

arguments on the gendered nature of the social contract, legal frameworks, and economic systems. 
Highlight the intersectional approach in feminist theory, emphasizing its relevance in addressing 
multiple dimensions of oppression. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the importance of feminist theory in redefining the role of the state, advocating for policies 

that promote gender equality and accommodate the diversity of women's experiences across different 
social axes. 

 
Feminist theory of the state is a diverse and evolving field that critically examines how state institutions, 
policies, and practices reflect and reinforce gender inequalities and patriarchal structures. Feminist theorists 
argue that the state is not a neutral arbiter of social issues but is deeply implicated in the construction and 
perpetuation of gender hierarchies. This critical perspective seeks to uncover the ways in which the state 
shapes gender relations and to advocate for transformative changes that promote gender equality and social 
justice.

PSIR By Vivek Waghmare  

One of the foundational texts in feminist political theory is Carole Pateman's "The Sexual Contract" (1988), 
where she argues that the social contract—a cornerstone of Western political thought—is inherently 
gendered. Pateman critiques classical social contract theorists like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, showing how 
their theories presuppose and legitimize male dominance over women. She introduces the concept of the 
"sexual contract," asserting that the social contract effectively excludes women by establishing a political 
order based on male authority and control over women's bodies and labor. Pateman's work highlights the 
need to reconceptualize consent, autonomy, and democracy from a feminist perspective. 
 
Catherine MacKinnon, in "Toward a Feminist Theory of the State" (1989), provides another influential critique, 
focusing on how legal and political frameworks institutionalize male power and subjugate women. MacKinnon 
contends that the state, through its laws and enforcement mechanisms, reinforces patriarchal norms that 
marginalize women's experiences and interests. She argues that gender inequality is not merely a result of 
individual actions or attitudes but is embedded within the structures of power and authority that the state 
embodies and enforces. 
 
Another important contribution comes from Nancy Fraser, who in works like "Fortunes of Feminism: From 
State-Managed Capitalism to Neoliberal Crisis" (2013), critiques both the capitalist state and neoliberalism 
from a feminist perspective. Fraser emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the economic 
dimensions of gender inequality, arguing that the feminist project must engage with issues of redistribution, 
recognition, and representation. She advocates for a form of "transformative" politics that aims to restructure 
the economic, cultural, and political dimensions of society to achieve genuine gender equality. 
 
Feminist theories of the state also engage with the intersections of gender with race, class, sexuality, and 
nationality, highlighting the importance of an intersectional approach in understanding state power and 
gender relations. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work on intersectionality, for example, underscores how women's 
experiences of oppression are shaped by multiple, intersecting identities, and how state policies can 
differentially impact women based on these intersections. 
 
In contemporary debates, feminist theorists continue to explore the role of the state in addressing issues such 
as violence against women, reproductive rights, economic inequality, and political representation. They argue 
for policies and practices that recognize and accommodate the diversity of women's experiences and that 
actively work to dismantle patriarchal and oppressive structures. 
 
In summary, feminist theory of the state offers a critical analysis of how state institutions and practices are 
implicated in the maintenance of gender inequality. It challenges traditional understandings of political power 
and calls for a reimagining of the state that is inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the needs and aspirations 
of all women. Through its diverse and intersectional approaches, feminist theory of the state contributes to a 
broader project of achieving social justice and gender equality.

Q.11) Critically examine the Neoliberal theory of state. (2018) (20) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Present the neoliberal theory of the state as a reaction against the Keynesian welfare state, emphasizing 

its advocacy for minimal government intervention and the primacy of free markets, as influenced by 
thinkers like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. 

Body:  
• Outline the foundational arguments of Hayek and Friedman regarding the role of the state in ensuring 

market functionality and individual freedom. Discuss the critiques of neoliberalism, including increased 
economic inequality, social insecurity, and environmental concerns, citing critics like David Harvey and 
Joseph Stiglitz. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the tensions within neoliberal theory between promoting individual liberty and the 

observed outcomes like rising inequality and environmental neglect, highlighting the ongoing debate 
over the appropriate level of state involvement in the economy.  

 
The neoliberal theory of the state represents a significant shift from the Keynesian welfare state model that 
dominated much of the mid-20th century, particularly in Western economies. Neoliberalism advocates for a 
minimal state, arguing that economic freedom and individual liberty are paramount and best achieved through 
free markets, limited government intervention, and the privatization of public services. The origins of 
neoliberal thought can be traced back to economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, who 
criticized government overreach and the inefficiencies of state-controlled economies. 
 
Friedrich Hayek, in "The Road to Serfdom" (1944), vehemently opposed any form of central planning or 
economic control by the state, arguing it inevitably leads to totalitarianism. He believed in the superiority of 
the free market as a mechanism for organizing economic activity and distributing resources. Hayek argued 
that the state's role should be confined to creating and maintaining the legal framework necessary for 
competitive markets to function, such as enforcing contracts and protecting property rights. 
 
Milton Friedman further developed neoliberal ideas in works like "Capitalism and Freedom" (1962), where he 
advocated for the deregulation of industries, the abolition of price controls, and the reduction of government 
spending as means to increase economic efficiency and personal freedom. For Friedman, the free market was 
not only an economic imperative but a prerequisite for political freedom, suggesting that economic freedom 
necessarily leads to political freedom. 
 
The neoliberal theory of the state has been critiqued for several reasons. Critics argue that it leads to increased 
inequality, as the removal of state interventions tends to benefit those already in possession of economic 
resources while disadvantaging the poor and marginalized. David Harvey, in "A Brief History of Neoliberalism" 
(2005), contends that neoliberal policies have exacerbated wealth disparities and consolidated power in the 
hands of a small elite, undermining the very notion of democratic equality. 
Another critical perspective comes from the social realm, where neoliberal policies are seen to erode the social 
safety net provided by welfare states, leading to greater social insecurity and diminished quality of life for the 
working and middle classes. This critique is articulated by scholars like Joseph Stiglitz in "The Price of

Inequality" (2012), where he highlights how neoliberal policies have led to less social mobility and greater 
economic polarization. 
 
Furthermore, critics argue that neoliberalism's emphasis on economic efficiency overlooks environmental 
concerns, leading to unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. The deregulation of industry and the 
privatization of public goods are seen to contribute to environmental degradation, contradicting the notion of 
sustainable development. 
 
In summary, while the neoliberal theory of the state advocates for a reduced role of government in the 
economy, emphasizing free markets and individual liberties, it has faced significant critique for increasing 
inequality, eroding social welfare, and neglecting environmental sustainability. These critiques suggest that 
the outcomes of neoliberal policies may, in fact, undermine the theory's own ideals of freedom and efficiency, 
pointing to the need for a more balanced approach to government intervention in the economy.
